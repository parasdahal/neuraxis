"bromwell high is a cartoon comedy. it ran at the same time as some other programs about school life, such as ""teachers"". my 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that bromwell high's satire is much closer to reality than is ""teachers"". the scramble to survive financially, the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers' pomp, the pettiness of the whole situation, all remind me of the schools i knew and their students. when i saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school, i immediately recalled ......... at .......... high. a classic line: inspector: i'm here to sack one of your teachers. student: welcome to bromwell high. i expect that many adults of my age think that bromwell high is far fetched. what a pity that it isn't!"	0
"homelessness (or houselessness as george carlin stated) has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school, work, or vote for the matter. most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism, the war on iraq, pressuring kids to succeed, technology, the elections, inflation, or worrying if they'll be next to end up on the streets.<br /><br />but what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home, the entertainment sets, a bathroom, pictures on the wall, a computer, and everything you once treasure to see what it's like to be homeless? that is goddard bolt's lesson.<br /><br />mel brooks (who directs) who stars as bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival (jeffery tambor) to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries; if bolt succeeds, he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings. the bet's on where bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he can't step off the sidewalk. he's given the nickname pepto by a vagrant after it's written on his forehead where bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of molly (lesley ann warren) an ex-dancer who got divorce before losing her home, and her pals sailor (howard morris) and fumes (teddy wilson) who are already used to the streets. they're survivors. bolt isn't. he's not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where it's fight or flight, kill or be killed.<br /><br />while the love connection between molly and bolt wasn't necessary to plot, i found ""life stinks"" to be one of mel brooks' observant films where prior to being a comedy, it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as blazing saddles, young frankenstein, or spaceballs for the matter, to show what it's like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they don't know what to do with their money. maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like monopoly money.<br /><br />or maybe this film will inspire you to help others."	0
"brilliant over-acting by lesley ann warren. best dramatic hobo lady i have ever seen, and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none. the corn on face is a classic, as good as anything in blazing saddles. the take on lawyers is also superb. after being accused of being a turncoat, selling out his boss, and being dishonest the lawyer of pepto bolt shrugs indifferently ""i'm a lawyer"" he says. three funny words. jeffrey tambor, a favorite from the later larry sanders show, is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto. his character is more malevolent than usual. the hospital scene, and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site, are all-time classics. look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting (one bleeds). this movie gets better each time i see it (which is quite often)."	0
this is easily the most underrated film inn the brooks cannon. sure, its flawed. it does not give a realistic view of homelessness (unlike, say, how citizen kane gave a realistic view of lounge singers, or titanic gave a realistic view of italians you idiots). many of the jokes fall flat. but still, this film is very lovable in a way many comedies are not, and to pull that off in a story about some of the most traditionally reviled members of society is truly impressive. its not the fisher king, but its not crap, either. my only complaint is that brooks should have cast someone else in the lead (i love mel as a director and writer, not so much as a lead).	0
"this is not the typical mel brooks film. it was much less slapstick than most of his movies and actually had a plot that was followable. leslie ann warren made the movie, she is such a fantastic, under-rated actress. there were some moments that could have been fleshed out a bit more, and some scenes that could probably have been cut to make the room to do so, but all in all, this is worth the price to rent and see it. the acting was good overall, brooks himself did a good job without his characteristic speaking to directly to the audience. again, warren was the best actor in the movie, but ""fume"" and ""sailor"" both played their parts well."	0
this isn't the comedic robin williams, nor is it the quirky/insane robin williams of recent thriller fame. this is a hybrid of the classic drama without over-dramatization, mixed with robin's new love of the thriller. but this isn't a thriller, per se. this is more a mystery/suspense vehicle through which williams attempts to locate a sick boy and his keeper.<br /><br />also starring sandra oh and rory culkin, this suspense drama plays pretty much like a news report, until william's character gets close to achieving his goal.<br /><br />i must say that i was highly entertained, though this movie fails to teach, guide, inspect, or amuse. it felt more like i was watching a guy (williams), as he was actually performing the actions, from a third person perspective. in other words, it felt real, and i was able to subscribe to the premise of the story.<br /><br />all in all, it's worth a watch, though it's definitely not friday/saturday night fare.<br /><br />it rates a 7.7/10 from...<br /><br />the fiend :.	0
yes its an art... to successfully make a slow paced thriller.<br /><br />the story unfolds in nice volumes while you don't even notice it happening.<br /><br />fine performance by robin williams. the sexuality angles in the film can seem unnecessary and can probably affect how much you enjoy the film. however, the core plot is very engaging. the movie doesn't rush onto you and still grips you enough to keep you wondering. the direction is good. use of lights to achieve desired affects of suspense and unexpectedness is good.<br /><br />very nice 1 time watch if you are looking to lay back and hear a thrilling short story!	0
"in this ""critically acclaimed psychological thriller based on true events, gabriel (robin williams), a celebrated writer and late-night talk show host, becomes captivated by the harrowing story of a young listener and his adoptive mother (toni collette). when troubling questions arise about this boy's (story), however, gabriel finds himself drawn into a widening mystery that hides a deadly secret"" according to film's official synopsis.<br /><br />you really should stop reading these comments, and watch the film now...<br /><br />the ""how did he lose his leg?"" ending, with ms. collette planning her new life, should be chopped off, and sent to ""deleted scenes"" land. it's overkill. the true nature of her physical and mental ailments should be obvious, by the time mr. williams returns to new york. possibly, her blindness could be in question - but a revelation could have be made certain in either the ""highway"" or ""video tape"" scenes. the film would benefit from a re-editing - how about a ""director's cut""? <br /><br />williams and bobby cannavale (as jess) don't seem, initially, believable as a couple. a scene or two establishing their relationship might have helped set the stage. otherwise, the cast is exemplary. williams offers an exceptionally strong characterization, and not a ""gay impersonation"". sandra oh (as anna), joe morton (as ashe), and rory culkin (pete logand) are all perfect.<br /><br />best of all, collette's ""donna"" belongs in the creepy hall of fame. ms. oh is correct in saying collette might be, ""you know, like that guy from 'psycho'."" there have been several years when organizations giving acting awards seemed to reach for women, due to a slighter dispersion of roles; certainly, they could have noticed collette with some award consideration. she is that good. and, director patrick stettner definitely evokes hitchcock - he even makes getting a sandwich from a vending machine suspenseful.<br /><br />finally, writers stettner, armistead maupin, and terry anderson deserve gratitude from flight attendants everywhere.<br /><br />******* the night listener (1/21/06) patrick stettner ~ robin williams, toni collette, sandra oh, rory culkin"	0
the night listener (2006) **1/2 robin williams, toni collette, bobby cannavale, rory culkin, joe morton, sandra oh, john cullum, lisa emery, becky ann baker. (dir: patrick stettner) <br /><br />hitchcockian suspenser gives williams a stand-out low-key performance.<br /><br />what is it about celebrities and fans? what is the near paranoia one associates with the other and why is it almost the norm? <br /><br />in the latest derange fan scenario, based on true events no less, williams stars as a talk-radio personality named gabriel no one, who reads stories he's penned over the airwaves and has accumulated an interesting fan in the form of a young boy named pete logand (culkin) who has submitted a manuscript about the travails of his troubled youth to no one's editor ashe (morton) who gives it to no one to read for himself. <br /><br />no one is naturally disturbed but ultimately intrigued about the nightmarish existence of pete being abducted and sexually abused for years until he was finally rescued by a nurse named donna (collette giving an excellent performance) who has adopted the boy but her correspondence with no one reveals that pete is dying from aids. naturally no one wants to meet the fans but is suddenly in doubt to their possibly devious ulterior motives when the seed is planted by his estranged lover jess (cannavale) whose sudden departure from their new york city apartment has no one in an emotional tailspin that has only now grown into a tempest in a teacup when he decides to do some investigating into donna and pete's backgrounds discovering some truths that he didn't anticipate.<br /><br />written by armistead maupin (who co-wrote the screenplay with his former lover terry anderson and the film's novice director stettner) and based on a true story about a fan's hoax found out has some hitchcockian moments that run on full tilt like any good old fashioned pot-boiler does. it helps that williams gives a stand-out, low-key performance as the conflicted good-hearted personality who genuinely wants to believe that his number one fan is in fact real and does love him (the one thing that has escaped his own reality) and has some unsettling dreadful moments with the creepy collette whose one physical trait i will leave unmentioned but underlines the desperation of her character that can rattle you to the core.<br /><br />however the film runs out of gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable despite a finely directed piece of hoodwink and mystery by stettner, it pays to listen to your own inner voice: be careful of what you hope for.	0
"you know, robin williams, god bless him, is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade (with perhaps the exception of ""death to smoochy"", which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic). the dramas he has made lately have been fantastic, especially ""insomnia"" and ""one hour photo"". ""the night listener"", despite mediocre reviews and a quick dvd release, is among his best work, period.<br /><br />this is a very chilling story, even though it doesn't include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter. the concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed. in high school, i read an autobiography by a child named anthony godby johnson, who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted aids as a result. i was moved by the story until i read reports online that johnson may not actually exist. when i saw this movie, the confused feelings that robin williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mind.<br /><br />toni collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic ""caretaker"". her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like ""little miss sunshine"". there were even times she looked into the camera where i thought she was staring right at me. it takes a good actress to play that sort of role, and it's this understated (yet well reviewed) role that makes toni collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an academy award (as of 2008). it's incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this, and it's scary too.<br /><br />this is a good, dark film that i highly recommend. be prepared to be unsettled, though, because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end."	0
"when i first read armistead maupins story i was taken in by the human drama displayed by gabriel no one and those he cares about and loves. that being said, we have now been given the film version of an excellent story and are expected to see past the gloss of hollywood...<br /><br />writer armistead maupin and director patrick stettner have truly succeeded! <br /><br />with just the right amount of restraint robin williams captures the fragile essence of gabriel and lets us see his struggle with issues of trust both in his personnel life(jess) and the world around him(donna).<br /><br />as we are introduced to the players in this drama we are reminded that nothing is ever as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably. the request to review a book written by a young man turns into a life changing event that helps gabriel find the strength within himself to carry on and move forward.<br /><br />it's to bad that most people will avoid this film. i only say that because the average american will probably think ""robin williams in a serious role? that didn't work before!"" please give this movie a chance! robin williams touches the darkness we all must find and go through in ourselves to be better people. like his movie one hour photo he has stepped up as an actor and made another quality piece of art.<br /><br />oh and before i forget, i believe bobby cannavale as jess steals every scene he is in. he has the 1940's leading man looks and screen presence. it's this hacks opinion he could carry his own movie right now!!<br /><br />s~"	0
i liked the film. some of the action scenes were very interesting, tense and well done. i especially liked the opening scene which had a semi truck in it. a very tense action scene that seemed well done.<br /><br />some of the transitional scenes were filmed in interesting ways such as time lapse photography, unusual colors, or interesting angles. also the film is funny is several parts. i also liked how the evil guy was portrayed too. i'd give the film an 8 out of 10.	0
"there are many illnesses born in the mind of man which have been given life in modern times. constant vigilance or accrued information in the realm of pyschosis, have kept psychologists, counselors and psychiatrists busy with enough work to last them decades. occasionally, some of these mental phenomenon are discover by those with no knowledge of their remedy or even of their existence. that is the premise of the film entitled "" the night listner."" it tells the story of a popular radio host called gabriel noon (robin williams) who spends his evenings enthralling his audiences with vivid stories about gay lifestyles. perhaps its because his show is losing it's authentic veneer which causes noon to admit he is no longer himself. feeling abandoned by both his lover jess (bobby cannavale) and his and best friend (joe morton), he seeks shelter in his deepening despair and isolation. it is here, a mysterious voice in the night asks him for help. noon needs to feel useful and reaches out to the desperate voice which belongs to a 14 year old boy called peter (rory culkin). in reading the boy's harrowing manuscript which depicts the early life and sexual abuse at the hands of his brutal parents, noon is captivated and wants to help. however, things are not what they seem and noon soon finds himself en-wrapped in an elusive and bizarre tale torn right out of a medical nightmare. this movie is pure robin williams and were it not for toni collette who plays donna d. logand, sandra oh as anna and john cullum as pop, this might be comical. instead, this may prove to be one of william's more serious performances. ***"	0
i enjoyed the night listener very much. it's one of the better movies of the summer.<br /><br />robin williams gives one of his best performances. in fact, the entire cast was very good. all played just the right notes for their characters - not too much and not too little. sandra oh adds a wonderful comic touch. toni collette is great as the mom, and never goes over the top. everyone is very believable.<br /><br />it's a short movie, just under an hour and a half. i noticed the general release version is nine minutes shorter than the sundance version. i wonder if some of the more disturbing images were cut from the movie.<br /><br />the director told a story and did it in straightforward fashion, which is a refreshing change from many directors these days who seem to think their job is to impress the audience rather than tell a story and tell it well.<br /><br />do not be sucker punched by the previews and ads. it is not a hitchcockian thriller. see the night listener because you want to see a good story told well. if you go expecting hitchcock you will be disappointed.<br /><br />my only complaint with the movie was the ending. the director could have left a little more to the audience's imagination, but this is a minor quibble.	0
the night listener is probably not one of william's best roles, but he makes a very interesting character in a somewhat odd but very different movie. i can guarantee you that you have never seen this kind of movie before. some people maybe won't like the slow pacing of this movie, but i think it's the great plus of the movie. it is definitely one of the top movies that have come out the year 2006. it has a intriguing performance in a movie with a great content, dramatic feeling. this is no americanized movie. neither is it a predictable movie. you just feel that it is a movie that has secrets which you have a hard time to determine what the outcome of it may be. this is no excellent movie that has everything, but hell, it's a damn good and very original movie.	0
"like one of the previous commenters said, this had the foundations of a great movie but something happened on the way to delivery. such a waste because collette's performance was eerie and williams was believable. i just kept waiting for it to get better. i don't think it was bad editing or needed another director, it could have just been the film. it came across as a canadian movie, something like the first few seasons of x-files. not cheap, just hokey. also, it needed a little more suspense. something that makes you jump off your seat. the movie reached that moment then faded away; kind of like a false climax. i can see how being too suspenseful would have taken away from the ""reality"" of the story but i thought that part was reached when gabriel was in the hospital looking for the boy. this movie needs to have a director's cut that tries to fix these problems."	0
the night listener held my attention, with robin williams shining as a new york city radio host who becomes enamored with his friendship with a 14 year old boy (rory culkin) who is very ill. williams has never met the boy in person, as they have only been in contact by talking on the telephone. however, williams' ex-boyfriend (nice job from bobby cannavale) raises doubt about the boy, which prompts williams to arrange a meeting with him in person. what follows makes a permanent impact on williams in a way he does not expect. i will leave it at that. toni collette also stars.<br /><br />i enjoyed this film, with toni collette giving a memorable portrayal of culkin's adoptive mother. sandra oh also starred as williams' friend. the night listener is inspired by actual events, and it has a somber, almost creepy silence throughout. at times it is predictable, no thanks to some of the reviews i read before seeing the movie and just due to logic, but i liked it anyway. i enjoy williams in roles like this, more so than his comedic characters so that was an added bonus for me. recommended. 8/10	0
popular radio storyteller gabriel no one(robin williams,scraggy and speaking in hushed,hypnotic tones) becomes acquainted and friends with a fourteen-year-old boy from wisconsin named pete logand(rory culkin),who has written a book detailing sexual abuse from his parents. to boot,pete has aids and this compels gabriel further still,since his partner jess(bobby cannavale,good)happens to be a survivor of hiv himself. <br /><br />he also acquaints himself with pete's guardian,a woman named donna(toni collette,brilliant!)and when gabriel decides he wants to meet and talk to the two of them in person and goes to wisconsin,he discovers some secrets he was(naturally)not prepared to find.<br /><br />based on real events that happened to armistead maupin(who co-wrote the screenplay with terry anderson)and directed by patrick stetner,this film moves a lot faster(90 min.,maybe a few minutes longer)than one might think a movie of this genre would run. that's good in that it keeps the action and storyline lean and clear. it's bad in that it leaves various holes in the plot and doesn't sew-up any of the plot openings or back-story. i'd rather not go into any great detail except to say that,if you are not familiar with mr.maupin's works or his personal story,you feel a little bit out of the loop here. still,the performances by williams( i would've loved to heard more of his narration,personally),collette,cannavale,culkin and much of the supporting cast(the waitress at the restaurant collete's donna frequents does a great job with what small part she has!)are top-notch and the mood established here--namely,the chilly,lonely dark exteriors of wisconsin and new york--give a terrific framing for this story. it may have ends that don't tie together particularly well,but it's still a compelling enough story to stick with.	0
if there is one thing to recommend about this film is that it is intriguing. the premise certainly draws the audience in because it is a mystery, and throughout the film there are hints that there is something dark lurking about. however, there is not much tension, and williams' mild mannered portrayal doesn't do much to makes us relate to his obsession with the boy.<br /><br />collete fares much better as the woman whose true nature and intentions are not very clear. the production felt rushed and holes are apparent. it certainly feels like a preview for a much more complete and better effort. the book is probably better.<br /><br />one thing is certain: taupin must have written something truly good to have inspired at least one commendable effort.	0
"this night listener is better than people are generally saying. it has weaknesses, and it seems to be having a genre identity crisis, no doubt, but i think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for this. the whole thing feels like one of those fireside ""this happened to a friend of a friend of mine"" ghost stories. one big complaint about the movie is the pacing: but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is deliberate. everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility, and real life just sort of plods alongno? so there are no flashy endings or earth-shattering revelations, no ""showdown"" scenes. thank heaven. you have to get into the zone when watching this movie, forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a (conventionally)good movie. williams isn't terrific, but he easily meets the needs of the story, plus his character is supposed to be somewhat generic (""no one"") as he is the everyman, the avatar by which we ourselves enter the story. toni collette's performance should be nominated for an oscar (even if she maybe shouldn't win it). give it a shot. for quality and content alone, the night listener is surely in the top twenty percent of movies coming out these days."	0
"when it comes to movies i can be pretty picky, and i'll complain about anything and everything that is done wrong. while every movie has its flaws, the night listener had an exceptionally low count.<br /><br />if you read the last review (it was hard, since half of it was written in caps and it contained no actual information about the movie), you may have been led to believe that this movie was not too well done. unfortunately, if you read more than 3 lines into that same review, you discovered the poster's reason for disdain: he/she does not like the fact that the director is gay (or that the production team smokes crack...apparently).<br /><br />so, despite the fact that i have never written a review before, i thought this movie deserved one based on its merits, not the sexual orientation of its director. let's go over a quick checklist first: 1. great plot? absolutely. i won't give a shred of it away, but the plot is highly compelling and definitely not what one would expect based on the commercials. this is a thriller, not a horror, and it should be approached as such. the story really will amaze you, even more so because it's true (and the plot did stay quite faithful to the actual events).<br /><br />2. wonderful acting? oh yes. robin williams long ago broke free from the chains of the comedy type-cast, and he has since flourished in serious roles for which many people would have wrote him off just a decade ago. he once again achieves high form in his role in the night listener, playing a radio host who becomes increasingly troubled by and entangled in a case of...well, i'll let you see for yourself.<br /><br />3. excellent direction? certainly. now, unlike the other poster to which i referred, i actually know something about direction. i've been sutdying the art of direction at school now for 3 years. of course i really don't think that makes a lick of difference (the only thing that matters is if you like the direction), but i thought i should simply establish once again that i'm basing my opinions here on something both substantial and relevant...for example: not the sexual orientation of the director (or the alleged drug habits of the production team, lol).<br /><br />patrick stettner's direction was moody and dark, and he allowed the angles and lighting to help create those so-sought-after feelings of ""tension and release"" rather than the messy, fast-paced camera-work and quick cuts we're so often subjected to today. some people can truly show you a story through their camera, while other's feel as if they have to make the story with the camera. i really appreciate when someone these days has the courage to just use the camera as its supposed to be utilized, which is as an eyeball through which we all see.<br /><br />4. lighting, cinematography, and editing? great all around. i've already wrote so much, and i could go on about these last three things for another ten paragraphs, so i'll just wrap it up.<br /><br />in short, go see this movie. don't listen to people who have alterior motives for trashing it, especially if they're so stupid that they unknowingly reveal that motive 1/4 of the way through their post. enjoy the show! -ben"	0
"somewhat funny and well-paced action thriller that has jamie foxx as a hapless, fast-talking hoodlum who is chosen by an overly demanding u.s. treasury agent (david morse) to be released on the streets of new york to find a picky computer thief/hacker (doug hutchinson), who stole forty-two million dollars from the treasury and left two guards shot dead.<br /><br />""bait"" marks the sophomore feature for antoine fuqua (""the replacement killers"") and he handles the task fairly well even though it doesn't top his first movie. what the two films have in common is the action sequences, which are flat-out excellent.<br /><br />foxx is pretty good here although his character is annoying in the beginning, but throughout the film, i began to catch on. hutchinson is marvelous as the mastermind who can be ruthless as john malkovich and patient as the late laurence olivier was in ""marathon man"". morse is okay as the agent who comes up with the ingenious plan to get whoever did it at all cost."	0
"the legendary boris karloff ended his illustrious career by making four cheapie fright flick clunkers in mexico. this is the token moody period gothic horror entry from the bunch. karloff gives a typically spry and dignified performance as matthias morteval, an elderly eccentric patriarch who invites several of his petty, greedy and backbiting no-count relatives to his creepy rundown castle for the reading of a will. pretty soon the hateful guests are getting bumped off by lethal life-sized toy people who populate the place. onetime mexican sex symbol andres garcia of ""tintorera"" infamy portrays the dashing police officer hero and julissa looks absolutely ravishing as the sole likable female character. the clunky, plodding (non)direction, trite by-the-numbers script, ugly, washed-out cinematography, ridiculous murder set pieces (a gross fat slob gets blasted right in the face by a miniature cannon!), overwrought string score, morbid gloom-doom atmosphere, largely lousy acting (karloff notably excepted), cheesy mild gore, poor dubbing and rousing fiery conclusion all lend this enjoyably awful lemon a certain endearingly cruddy and hence oddly amusing ratty charm. a real campy hoot."	0
"this tale based on two edgar allen poe pieces (""the fall of the house of usher"", ""dance of death"" (poem) ) is actually quite creepy from beginning to end. it is similar to some of the old black-and-white movies about people that meet in an old decrepit house (for example, ""the cat and the canary"", ""the old dark house"", ""night of terror"" and so on). boris karloff plays a demented inventor of life-size dolls that terrorize the guests. he dies early in the film (or does he ? ) and the residents of the house are subjected to a number of terrifying experiences. i won't go into too much detail here, but it is definitely a must-see for fans of old dark house mysteries.<br /><br />watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened room.<br /><br />dan basinger 8/10"	0
"aro tolbukhin burnt alive seven people in a mission in guatemala in the 70's. also he declared that he had murdered another 16 people (he used to kill pregnant women, and then he set them on fire).<br /><br />this movie is a documentary that portraits the personality of aro through several interviews with people that got to know him and through some scenes played by actors based on real facts.<br /><br />""aro tolbukhin"" is a serious work, so analytical, it's not morbid at all. such a horrifying testimony about how some childhood trauma can turn a man into a monster.<br /><br />*my rate: 7/10"	0
after seeing several movies of villaronga, i had a pretty clear opinion about him -- he concentrates too much on the personal aspect of the characters, forgetting about a rhythm of the movie. that is why, though having good critics, his movies never caught the broad audience attention. in aro he follows the same line, but really improved on the rhythm, especially in the end of the movie. frankly speaking, i slept through the first part, cause though the first part gives necessary information, it is really slow. nevertheless the second part is absolutely marvelous and makes the whole movie the best movie ever made by villaronga.<br /><br />recommended.	0
there's so many things to fall for in aro tolbukhin. en la mente del asesino (inside the killer's mind), that it's very hard to talk about it without giving any kind of warning. let's just say that this movie is like an exercise in cinema but really, really great done. it´s made with super 8, black and white shots, 35 milimeters, color, interviews, flashbacks. aro tolbukhin it´s like a movie made a documental or viceversa, which most peculiar aspect relays on the doubt that leaves you wondering, did he really ever existed? the movie follows the later life of an hungarian sailor that arrived in guatemala, worked in a religious mission and then killed some people. an act for which he got caught and death penalty sentenced. the movie starts because some french documentalists got interested in this character so they interview him prior to his death. nowadays, some more people got involved and make a deeper research of the character. the one we are witness of -the movie.<br /><br />for the main part in the history we are guided by a semi slow phase to go look inside aro´s mind, mainly in order to decode why he did what he has done. nevertheless, the important thing is that the filmmakers never gives us a sided point of view; they left the judging for all of us and even as we may understand his actions, we clearly never justify them. so, the first half is based upon recollecting information; later things turn into aro's childhood, giving the movie such an incredible new force (even tough never got weak or boring).<br /><br />i don't mean -and don't want- to spoil anything; so the only thing left to say is that if by any chance you get this movie near you, believe me, the trip to see it is more than worthy.	0
this has got to be a unique twists of two genres of ever seen. the giant monster movie genre with the living mummy movie genre. this unique blend makes for a unique and compelling story. the casts is outstanding, including tom bosley who as far as i know never has been in a horror movie before, ever. the effects are impressive and the idea of a giant mummy filled with smaller mummies is a cool one. my one complaint, i just wish we saw more of the giant mummy, but other then that i think they did a great job. the dialog, the characters and the story was perfect. the acting was wonderful. this has got to be the best movie to come out of the sci-fi channel. you heard me, the best movie to come out of the sci-fi channel. i give the fallen ones 9 out of 10.	0
without kirsten miller this project needn't have been completed. however with the awe inspiring beauty and talent that is miss miller i would definitely recommend it. it looked as if the other actors were only playing to her strong performance. wagner's dismal attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing, but his few scenes didn't detract from being entertained. mostly my criticisms are with the writing and plot line, the group of talent assembled did a heroic job of salvaging what should have been a disaster. the charismatic miller delivery and timing were impeccable and believable. she plays that fine line between assertive and bossy but never offensive she is in fact the structural engineer she claims to be. i wish i had seen this on the big screen but alas i was fortunate to rent it before it was lost.	0
sure, titanic was a good movie, the first time you see it, but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change. the first time you see the movie you see the underlying love-story and think: ooh, how romantic. the second time (and i am not the only one to think this) it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking, when is this d**n ship going to sink??? and even this is not as impressive when you see it several times. the acting in this film is not bad, but definetly not great either. was i glad dicaprio did not win an oscar for that film, i mean who does he think he is, anthony hopkins or denzel washington? he does 1 half-good movie and won't do a film for less than $20 million. and then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it. but enough about, in my eyes, the worst character of the film. kate winslet's performance on the other hand was wonderful. i also tink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together. there is one lesson to be learned about this movie: there are too many love-stories as it is, filmmakers shouldn't try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie!!! out of a possible 100% i give this film a mere 71%.	0
when i saw this movie i was stunned by what a great movie it was. this is the only movie i think i would ever give a 10 star rating. i am sure this movie will always be in my top 5.<br /><br />the acting is superb. leonardo dicaprio and kate winslett are at their best. i don't think anyone could have a better job than kate. <br /><br />if it is a rainy day and you can't decide what to rent, well, this is the one. you will love all the acting, special effects, and much much more.<br /><br />if you have not seen this movie go rent or buy it now!!! you won't regret it.<br /><br />	0
why do people bitch about this movie and not about awful movies like the godfather. titanic is the greatest movie of the 21st century.with great acting,directing,effects,music and generally everything. this movie is always dumped by all because one day some one said they didn't like it any more so most of the world decided to agree. there is nothing wrong with this movie. all i can say is that this movie, not only being the most heavily oscar awarded movie of all time, the most money ever made ever and sadly one of the most underrated movies i've ever seen. apart from that it is truly the best movie of all time. the only movies that come close to being like all the star wars and the lord of the rings trilogy or anything by the masters hitchcock or spielberg or tim burton. these are all good movies and directors but none match up to james cameron's masterpiece titanic.	0
"just two comments....seven years apart? hardly evidence of the film's relentless pulling-power! as has been mentioned, the low-budget telemovie status of 13 gantry row is a mitigating factor in its limited appeal. having said that however the thing is not without merit - either as entertainment or as a fright outing per se.<br /><br />true, the plot at its most basic is a re-working of the amityville horror - only without much horror. more a case of intrigue! gibney might have made a more worthwhile impression if she had played halifax -investigating a couple of seemingly unconnected murders with the ""house"" as the main suspect. the script is better than average and the production overall of a high standard. it just fails to engage the viewer particularly at key moments.<br /><br />having picked the dvd up for a mere $3.95 last week at my regular video store, i cannot begrudge the expenditure. $10.95 would be an acceptable price for the film. just don't expect fireworks!"	0
what's inexplicable? firstly, the hatred towards this movie. it may not be the greatest movie of all time, but gimme a break, it got 11 oscars for a reason, it made eighteen hundred million dollars for a reason. it's a damn good movie. which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it. i have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when i saw it in theaters. i've rewatched it on tv and video, and it had none of the impact it had when i saw it on the big screen (twice, or maybe three times, actually). but that might be it, the appeal of it. it's a movie, yes, capital m there, it's an epic, it's a spectacle in the order of gone with the wind or ben hur. now, ben hur and gone with the wind seem kinda hokey to me, with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama. not that titanic has none of that. well, the acting was actually very good. the melodrama was quite heavy-handed at times.<br /><br />but the reason titanic works is that it's such an emotional ride. i usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind, or give me a visual thrill. this movie isn't exactly dumb, but it's not cerebral at all. the visual thrills are simply means to an end, to fuel the emotions of the audience. i didn't cry when bambi's mom died, i don't react to tearjerkers. but this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million, an emotional rollercoaster that, if it were a regular one, would make buzz aldrin scream like a little girl. and i'm sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it, and have a ready supply of cynicism, then you can thoroughly dislike this movie. but if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit, if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt, you'll enjoy it completely. and look at the top ten grossing films of all time. is a single one of them bad? is a single one of them worth a score of 1 out of 10? no, not even the phantom menace. and this movie made 1.8 billion dollars worldwide. it can't be bad. not possible. 10/10.<br /><br />p.s. how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman? spiderman was a fun movie, but it was a total 9/11 kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did. it simply wasn't anything all that special. no one will remember it in 50 years. but i'm pretty sure titanic will be remembered.	0
"previously, i wrote that i loved ""titanic"", cried at its ending (many times over), and i'm a guy in his 60's. i also wondered about why this great movie, which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics, was given only a 7.0 rating by imdb.com users.<br /><br />well, i looked at the breakdown of the user ratings. while 29.0% of all votes gave it a 10 rating, 10.7% gave it a 1 rating. these 10.7% of these irrational imdb users, in effect, pulled the overall rating down to 7.0. <br /><br />in my previous comments, i blamed this very unusual voting pattern (a sudden surge in 1 ratings, with a high 10 rating, dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the 1 rating level) on only one thing: hatred for leonardo dicaprio. believe me, i've tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people (young men, mostly), who defame him left and right. they absolutely hate the man, and they will have no part in giving him any credit in ""titanic"". (to answer one other user: i am not talking about someone who just really doesn't like the movie that much, and gave it a 5 or a 6, etc. everyone has, and is entitled to, his/her own taste. but no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only 7.0 overall for ""titanic"", pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous 1 ratings, is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture.)<br /><br />let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of ""titanic"" to 5 randomly chosen box office and critical ""bombs"" (there are many more, but these 5 will prove my point). ""heaven's gate"" (1980) was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing, and imdb voters' ratings were: 23.2% 10 ratings and 9.2% 1 ratings (overall rating of 6.1). ""big top pee-wee"" (1988) got 4.3% 10 ratings and 9.9% 1 ratings (overall rating of 4.5). ""cat people"" (1982) got 6.1% 10 ratings and 2.6% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.8). ""blind date"" (1987) got 3.0% 10 ratings and 2.8% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.3). ""jumpin' jack flash"" (1986) got 4.4% 10 ratings and 3.7% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.2). what do all of these films have in common with ""titanic""? all of the percentages of their 1 ratings are lower !!!! than ""titanic"", and none of these stinkers ever was nominated for a single award. again, ""titanic"" got 10.7% 1 ratings! compare that to the other 5 movies i just mentioned.<br /><br />can there be any explanation other than the hatred of leo factor?<br /><br />"	0
i loved this movie since i was 7 and i saw it on the opening day. it was so touching and beautiful. i strongly recommend seeing for all. it's a movie to watch with your family by far.<br /><br />my mpaa rating: pg-13 for thematic elements, prolonged scenes of disastor, nudity/sexuality and some language.	0
"the movie titanic makes it much more then just a ""night to remember."" it re writes a tragic history event that will always be talked about and will never been forgotten. why so criticised? i have no idea. could/will they ever make a movie like titanic that is so moving and touching every time you watch it. could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece. it will be almost impossible.<br /><br />the director no doubt had the major impact on the film. a simple disaster film (boring to watch) converted to an unbelievable romance. yes i'm not the romance type either, but that should not bother you, because you will never see a romance like this. guaranteed! everything to the amazing effects, to the music, to the sublime acting. <br /><br />the movie creates an amazing visual and a wonderful feeling. everything looks very real and live. the legend herself ""titanic"" is shown brilliantly in all classes, too looks, too accommodation. the acting was the real effect. dicaprio and winslet are simply the best at playing there roles. no one could have done better. they are partly the reason why the film is so great. <br /><br />i guess it's not too much to talk about. the plot is simple, the acting is brilliant, based on a true story, probably more then half of the consumers that watch the film will share tears, thanks to un imaginable ending which can never be forgotten. well if you haven't seen this film your missing out on something hesterical, and a film to idolise for hollywood. could it get better? no. not at all. the most moving film of all time, don't listen to people, see for yourself then you will understand. a landmark. (don't be surprised if you cry too)"	0
"i think james cameron might be becoming my favorite director because this is my second review of his movies. anyway, everyone remembers the rms titanic. it was big, fast, and ""unsinkable""... until april 1912. it was all over the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever. well james cameron decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship. well, onto the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the film.<br /><br />so our two main characters are jack (leonardo dicaprio) and rose (kate winslet). they're not annoying too much but watch this and you'll find out why they could become annoying ( http://tinyurl.com/ojhoyn ). the main villain i guess is bad luck, fate, hand of god (no blasphemy intended), or just plain caledon hockley (billy zane). combine all of the above and what do you get?! oh yes! we get a love story on a sinking boat. the supporting characters are the following: my personal favorite, mr. andrews (victor garber)(idk he was so nice), lovejoy(david warner), murdoch(ewan stewart), lightoller (jonathan phillips), captain smith(bernard hill), molly brown(kathy bates), and many more. we also got the present day treasure hunter, brock lovett (bill paxton). they add something to the story, something good. the action in here is awesome, especially in the second half, the drama as also good. in the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears. the story is simple and it works. a treasure hunter seeks the heart of the ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond. she calls and tells her tale on the rms titanic. two lovers separated by social class and ultimately, the fate of the ship. everything about the story works and there are very few flaws. i give titanic, an 86% awesome"	0
titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill-fated voyage on the unsinkable ship. writer/director james cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on april 15, 1912 claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the north atlantic. the two leads in the film are great in their roles including leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet. they make for a good on-screen couple. dicpario and winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable. they both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well. the rest of the supporting cast including billy zane, kathy bates, frances fisher, jonathan hyde, and bill paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film. the love story, the action, suspense, and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time. the horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation. the pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it's few flaws. titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it. the fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the titanic sunk into the atlantic after hitting an iceberg. overall titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill-fated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially dicaprio and winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch.	0
the ship may have sunk but the movie didn't!!! director, james cameron, from 'the terminator' did it again with this amazing picture. one of my favorite scenes is 'the dinner table' scene, in which rose's family and friends meet jack after he saves her. rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet 'the one'...i hope i have that look when i am in the room with my future husband.<br /><br />jack and rose have a connection that is 'movie stuff' but it's good movie stuff. we have the greedy mom and all her elite stuck up associates who live off of their husbands wealth. rose almost commits suicide but the gilbert grape star rescues her. i really liked the hanging over the boat scene. it was a good risk.<br /><br />the movie is long but it's fantastic!!! good story, good flow, good actors!!! go see it twice if you want, its worth it!!!	0
"titanic has to be one of my all-time favorite movies. it has its problems (what movies don't) but still, it's enjoyable.<br /><br />when i stumble across someone who asks me why i like titanic, i suppose my first reaction is ""wait a minute, you don't?"" i know so many people who don't like this movie, and i'm not saying i don't see why. ""the love story is too cheesy"" well, yes but isn't it enjoyable and moving? all right, the love story between jack and rose is very unrealistic, everyone knows that love like this doesn't actually exist. but this is a movie, doesn't everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while? the next complaint, dicaprio and winslet are terrible actors. well, ok, in this movie, i agree that they do not perform to their full potentials. however i think it's unfair to say that they are terrible actors. i personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in. but the roles they are given are simple, and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit, but i agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected.<br /><br />and finally, if one is going to complain that they don't like this movie because they hate romance, or because they hate history, or tragic movies, then i'm sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things. it's like people who complain the dark knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies. simply for being a movie, not because you dislike the genre, this is a good movie.<br /><br />well deserving of its oscars, in particular, best cinematography, which i find to be the best i've ever seen in a movie save maybe the lord of the rings trilogy.<br /><br />i know some of the writing fails, such as the constant screaming of each other's names throughout the movie. the flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times, but overall it's an amazing achievement in making the titanic look so real, and the sinking feel so epic.<br /><br />i understand why a lot of people dislike this movie, but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea, such as it being a love story, rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed.<br /><br />i can tell you that i have read more than five books about the titanic, including memoirs form the day it happened, and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults. the only main ones i can find is that the piping should be threaded copper, not steel, and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it.<br /><br />i give this movie 10/10, not because i like romance movies, but simply because it's an outstanding cinematic achievement, that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events."	0
"titanic is a classic. i was really surprised that this movie didn't have a solid ten, overall in the imdb user rankings. maybe, it's just cool to not give titanic credit nowadays, but when it was first made it was really something. when the movie came out people flocked to the theaters. when it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month. it was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason. some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot, like the frozen baby, or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd. many people died on that ship, and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that james cameron stepped up to. and let's not forget the amazing romance between jack and rose. whether or not their relationship was a figment of someone's imagination it was lovely. they barely knew each other, but they would die for each other. they trusted each other. they sure as hell are giving romeo and juliet a run for their money. ""i'll never let go, jack."" titanic is a great film down to it's very core. it is a powerful story told through brilliant acting, excellent cinematography, beautiful music, and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers. it really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie."	0
another aussie masterpiece, this delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural, and it does very well. it doesn't resort to the big special effects overkill like american flicks, it focuses more on emotional impact. a relatively simple plot that rebecca gibney & co. bring to life. it follows the story of a couple who buy an old house that was supposedly home to a very old woman who never went outside, and whose husband disappeared in mysterious circumstances a century ago. strange things begin to happen in the house, and john adam begins to turn into the man who disappeared, who was actually a mass murderer. highly recommended. 8/10	0
for me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time. no exceptions. james cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller. through films such as aliens, the abyss and both terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and science-fiction goes. he sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film. but titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance. the film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises, plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows. the story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for cameron to make a truthful, interesting and entertaining film about it. the acting is wonderful as leonardo dicaprio who plays jack and kate winslet who plays rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films i get annoyed when the supporting characters aren't given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly rose (gloria stuart) tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is rose's and jack's story alone, no one else. emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home. the music has become iconic and legendary. it is composer james horner's finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience. the song after so long has become annoying but i still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is. only one problem, the usual james cameron problem, is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside. james cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime. my heart won't go on from this one.	0
"back in 1997, do i remember that year: clinton bans cloning research, the unfortunate death of princess diana, the marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets. this was also the big year in the release of titanic, one of the biggest films of all time: a tale about the ship of dreams, about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster. i don't think anybody could have expected titanic to be as huge as it was, the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans, 85% of them being teenage girls, i was 12 years old at the time, and of course saw the movie multiple times. it was the film that made me believe that the love that jack and rose shared was so real and beautiful. at the time i felt that titanic could do no wrong, of course i grew up and didn't watch the film since i was 14, a couple years ago i saw the film on dvd for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what i thought about the movie now. was it worth the hype? was it really the best movie of all time? was that leonardo's real nose? ok, i know that's silly to say, but i did re-watch the film. being completely honest here, titanic is a great movie, best movie of all time, no, just depends on your idea of a good movie, but titanic delivered in romance, humor, disaster, emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyage.<br /><br />the film starts with brock lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the rms titanic, searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the heart of the ocean. unsuccessful, they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude, wearing the heart of the ocean, dated the day the titanic sank. 101-year-old rose dawson calvert learns of the drawing, and contacts lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing. she and her granddaughter elizabeth ""lizzy"" calvert visit lovett and his skeptical team on his salvage ship. when asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace, rose calvert recalls her memories aboard the titanic, revealing for the first time that she was rose dewitt bukater. in 1912, the upper-class 17-year-old rose boards the ship with her fiancé, cal hockley and her mother, ruth dewitt bukater, both of whom stress the importance of rose's engagement to cal since the marriage will mean the eradication of the dewitt-bukater debts: while they have the outward appearance of the upper-class, rose and her mother are financially broke. distraught and frustrated by her engagement to the controlling cal and the pressure her mother is putting on her to go through with the marriage, rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern. before she leaps, a drifter and artist named jack dawson intervenes. jack and rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life, and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching; their bond deepens when they leave a stuffy first-class formal dinner of the rapport-building wealthy for a much livelier gathering of irish dance, music and beer in third-class. but after cal's servant informs him of rose's whereabouts', rose is forbidden from seeing jack again. however, after witnessing a woman encouraging her seven-year-old daughter to behave like a ""proper lady"" at tea, rose defies him and her mother, asking jack to sketch her nude and wearing only the heart of the ocean, an engagement present from cal. after a beautiful moment together in the very first backseat fun time, they go to the deck of the ship.<br /><br />they then witness the ship's fatal collision with an iceberg. after overhearing the ship's lookouts discussing how serious the collision is, rose tells jack they should warn her mother and cal. meanwhile, cal discovers rose's nude drawing and her taunting note in his safe, so he frames jack for stealing the heart of the ocean by having lovejoy plant it in jack's pocket. upon learning cal intends to leave jack to die below deck, rose runs away from him and her mother to rescue him. jack and rose return to the top deck. cal and jack, though enemies, both want rose safe, so they persuade her to board a lifeboat. but after realizing that she cannot leave jack, rose jumps back on the ship and reunites with jack in the ship's first class staircase. jack and rose return to the top deck, the lifeboats have gone, and the ship finally goes down into the freezing atlantic taking jack and rose down.<br /><br />so does titanic live up to it's hype? i still say that this is a great movie to watch, i think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie. but it has great acting, amazing effects, a well-written story and still looks flawless. love it or hate it, you have to admit this movie didn't get a lot of hype just because of leo's baby face or kate's amazing ability to cry on sight, this film is something special. it will always hold a special place in my heart, it has too seeing that i saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released. but all that aside, i do recommend this movie, it's a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day.<br /><br />10/10"	0

this movie re-wrote film history in every way. no one cares what anyone thinks about this movie, because it transcends criticism. every flaw in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has going for it. it is an extremely beautiful movie, and i doubt many of us will see anything like it again. i've seen it more times than i care to count, and i still become transfixed every time, with a feeling which is hard to describe. one for the ages.	0
titanic directed by james cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the titanic. the plot is simple, noncomplicated, or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense. the end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film, but the love story is an interesting one, however. kate winslett is wonderful as rose, an aristocratic young lady betrothed by cal (billy zane). early on the voyage rose meets jack (leonardo dicaprio), a lower class artist on his way to america after winning his ticket aboard titanic in a poker game. if he wants something, he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries. the two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the titanic primarily through their eyes.<br /><br />the movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures, that sunk with the titanic, which has recently occurred. one of the survivors of the titanic, rose dewitt bukater, who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search. she gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the titanic. with this, the scene shifts to southhampton, ireland where the titanic set sail from on april 10, 1912 as all the passengers are boarding. after another stop on the irish coast titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the atlantic bound for new york. historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful, but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy cal hockley and falls in love with third class passenger, jack dawson. captain smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the white star line director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in new york on thursday night and not on friday morning as planned. smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty-two years of experience to stretch the titanic's legs out to full speed. the titanic had reports that the waters in the atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs, but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie. on april 15, 1912 at 11:39, an iceberg was sighted. they attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film. the portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate. the crew of titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 2:18 when the lights finally failed. the lights of the california were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to titanic's many pleas for help. the california had tried earlier in the day to warn titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but titanic had brushed them off causing the california to turn off its radio and leave the titanic on its own. the first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship. overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too. the word of white star line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking. also, the metal that was used to build the titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold, which were experienced the night titanic sank to be extremely brittle. overall, the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the titanic.<br /><br />many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship. the core group of rose, jack, cal, and rose's mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time. yet many characters such as the unsinkable molly brown; captain edward smith; the ship designer, thomas andrew; the white star line representative, bruce ismay; and all of the titanic's officers were real. the maiden voyage was going to be captain edward smith's last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards. he had been a part of the white star line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the millionaire's captain when the titanic sunk. the portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol. he is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that james cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officer's former canadian hometown. as shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower-class passengers from non-english speaking nations. in addition, officer lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted. the old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the strauss'. not wanting to leave her husband's side mrs. strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the titanic. furthermore, mr. goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best. the richest man on the ship, john jacob astor, who owned most of manhattan died nonetheless as well, but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat. in addition, molly brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the carpethia that picked the survivors of titanic up from the water. her ticket on the titanic had cost over four-thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke. all of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware. the gymnasium, which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs. the wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re-creation of the post-victorian era of 1912. the rich at this time practically ruled everything, as the women's suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet. women during this time often married for financial security as rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as cal wished for rose to do. the rich did not take well to `new money' such as molly brown as depicted. everything of the time was very formal. women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes. smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes, which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with rose in the movie. men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes. women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society. although james cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of titanic coupled with two years spent cross-referencing the history of the titanic and few liberties were taken. the beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking.<br /><br />a recognizable message can be seen in the movie titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise. the director, james cameron, shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in people's lives. everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the titanic on that fateful night. in addition, this film is a reflection of the 1990's when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the titanic. only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual titanic been found and explored. this movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed. however, the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed. there have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in titanic but all have failed. as it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter.<br /><br />technically the film is very well done. to get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie. in addition, a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean. cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship. furthermore, throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of titanic to the scene of titanic during its actual voyage. this shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner. at the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the european coast on titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film.<br /><br />titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art, a true epic. like most history novels, we know the ending, but it doesn't take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture. certain aspects of this film are academy award material including costuming, sound, cintematography, and editing. if you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900's and how they face disaster, then this movie definitely is for you.<br /><br

"i find it so amazing that even after all these years, we are still talking about this movie! obviously this movie wasn't that bad or else people wouldn't even bother to talk about it. i personally enjoyed this film immensly, and still do! i guess this film isn't for everyone, but it certainly did touch the hearts of many. <br /><br />as for those that think that this film is ""overrated"" or ""over-hyped""...well, we only have the movie-going public to thank for that! lol* you see, it's not critics/article writers that make a film ""huge"" or a ""hit"" with the general movie-going public. people make the film a huge success. with titanic, everyone was in awe. let's face it, a film like this had never been made before. at least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking. this film is so accurate that even james cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the real sinking that fateful day in april 1912. even the silverware for goodness sakes matched! <br /><br />give this movie a break you guys! the critics thought this movie would sink big time! when this movie actually came out and people started hearing by word of mouth (which is the best form of advertisement mind you) that this was a good/decent/movie worth seeing, then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie...not once, not twice, but maybe 3 times and more! so, i really wouldn't say that this movie was ""overhyped""...at least not like the buildup for the matrix reloaded or the hulk is being ""overhyped"". ha! critics didn't even think that titanic would make enough money to cover cameron's gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film. however, the films money took care of that 200 million budget and much more! <br /><br />personally, i love this film. however, this film might not be for everyone. don't say that this film sucks just because of romance though! that is the most sexist thing i've ever heard! disliking a movie just because it has romance in it! the story was sweet. the dialogue could have been better, but let's face it...the real star of the movie wasn't leo or kate...it was that gigantic ship! i think all of the actors including dicaprio and winslet did a fine job. it's not thier best work (i've seen much better work from both of them) but it wasn't the worst i've seen on screen before. give them a break!<br /><br />"	0
"i avoided watching this film for the longest time. long before it was even released i had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of hollywood schmaltz, and i wanted nothing to do with it. i never watched it in the theatre. i shook my head in disbelief at the 11 academy awards - even though i had never seen it. then i was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. one of the girls spoke about this movie. ""it was so great,"" she said. ""you really felt like you were on the ship."" ""nonsense,"" i thought. i shared my feelings with my fellow judges. one looked at me and said, ""you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about the real titanic. the movie must have done something right to get her so interested."" ""well, maybe,"" thought i. then it finally appeared on pay tv. ""ok,"" i thought, ""i'll give it a look see."" i didn't want to like it - and i didn't. i loved it! what a great movie.<br /><br />where to start? first - the directing. my high school public speaking contestant was right. james cameron does a superb job of creating an almost ""you are there"" type of atmosphere. the gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world. the nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads; then the rising sense of panic. you don't just watch it; you really do feel it. then - the performances. the lead performances from kate winslet (as rose) and leonardo dicaprio (as jack) are excellent - winslet's being the superior, i thought, but both were good. they had their rich girl/poor boy characters down to a perfect ""t"" i thought. in my opinion, though, stealing the show was frances fisher as rose's mother. she was perfect as the snobby aristocrat, and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at jack. then - the details. i'm no expert on the sinking of the titanic, but i have a reasonable general knowledge, and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance. very impressive, indeed. then - the song. who can watch this movie and not be taken with celine dion's performance of ""my heart goes on.""<br /><br />problems. well, the romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that i just don't accept that jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class. (i know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he's been there for a while.) the realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, i thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats. <br /><br />a minor quibble, though. this is truly an excellent movie. my only regret is not seeing it in the theatre, where i think it would have been so much more impressive.<br /><br />9/10"	0
to all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue, the budget, the this and the that....who wants to hear it? if you missed the point of this beyond-beautiful movie, that's your loss. the rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think. i am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one stands in its own entity, in my book. it was not supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night. it is the most amazing love story ever attempted. i know that it is the cynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on. someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money! how lame is that? it made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet, and is the top grossing film in the planet. i will gladly side with the majority this time around. okay, cynics, time to crawl back under your rock, i am done.	0
"every once in a while the conversation will turn to ""favorite movies."" i'll mention titanic, and at least a couple people will snicker. i pay them no mind because i know that five years ago, these same people were moved to tears by that very movie. and they're too embarrassed now to admit it.<br /><br />i just rewatched titanic for the first time in a long time. expecting to simply enjoy the story again, i was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years. i cried again.... in all the same places. it brought me back to 1997 when i can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time. a movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie i can recall (yes, even more than star wars). and today, many people won't even admit they enjoyed it. folks, let's get something straight -- you don't look cool when you badmouth this film. you look like an out of touch cynic.<br /><br />no movie is perfect and this one has a few faults. some of the dialogue falls flat, and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly. however, none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film.<br /><br />leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are wonderful. leo is one of the fine actors of his generation. wait 'til you see him in gangs of new york before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy. kate winslet was so strong in this film. the movie really was hers, and she held it together beautifully.<br /><br />james cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable titanic. the sinking scenes were horrific, just as they were that night. how anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me. i was utterly transfixed.<br /><br />this film is one memorable scene after another. titanic leaving port in southampton. rose and jack at the bow, ""flying"". ""iceberg, right ahead!"" the screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean. the screams of the doomed after she went down. and that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears.<br /><br />the music, which has also been a victim of the film's success, was a key ingredient. james horner's score was simply perfect. and the love theme was beautiful and tragic. too bad celine dion's pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many.<br /><br />i confess, i am a titanic buff. as such, i relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it -- in all its beauty. perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because i've had such an interest in the ship all my life. however, i doubt many of those i saw crying were titanic buffs. i applaud cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy. the film was made with such humanity.<br /><br />another reviewer said it better than i ever could: open up your hearts to titanic, and you will not be disappointed."	0
i am not a parent, neither am i a male. but i was able to identify with every character's heartaches and pains.<br /><br />this is a movie teenagers should watch. maybe that way they will start appreciating the value of family again. i'm sorry for those that don't understand the value of love, family and friendship.<br /><br />it was very interesting to watch patrick duffy in a different role than that of bobby ewing. and it is great to see a 19 year old ben affleck giving his best in a moving and sincere performance. he showed at an early age, that he is capable of heartfelt drama. he should be offered more serious roles. note hollywoodland... his first serious role in years and he went out and won best actor at the venice festival in 2006.<br /><br />this movie can be appreciated by people of all ages. maybe shouldn't be watched by children under 10 because they might get scared that the same may happen to their families, but i recommend it to the entire family.<br /><br />i bought this movie on dvd and have watched it with friends many times. because it portrays the values that are important in life.	0
"after a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted, urban, turn of the century australian street, we meet julie (rebecca gibney) and peter (john adam) as they go out house hunting. they manage to get a loan for a fixer-upper on a posh sydney street, but it turns out that physical disrepair is not the only problem with their new home. it just may be haunted.<br /><br />13 gantry row combines a memorable if somewhat clichéd story with good to average direction by catherine millar into a slightly above average shocker.<br /><br />the biggest flaws seem partially due to budget, but not wholly excusable to that hurdle. a crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film. the opening ""thriller scene"" features some wonky editing. freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that there's not much action. suspense should be created from staging, not fancy ""fix it in the mix"" techniques. there is great atmosphere in the scene from the location, the lighting, the fog and such, but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim, cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street, showing their increasing proximity. the tracking and the cuts need to be slow. the attack needed to be longer, clearer and better blocked. as it stands, the scene has a strong ""made for television"" feel, and a low budget one at that.<br /><br />after this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves. the story has a lot of similarities to the amityville horror (1979), though the budget forces a much subtler approach. millar and scriptwriter tony morphett effectively create a lot of slyly creepy scenarios, often dramatic in nature instead of special effects-oriented, such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old slabs of iron, which had been bizarrely affixed to an interior wall.<br /><br />for some horror fans, the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama. at least the first half hour of the film is primarily about julie and peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in. but morphett writes fine, intelligent dialogue. the material is done well enough that it's often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise later--especially if you've gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own house.<br /><br />once they get settled and things begin to get weirder, even though the special effects often leave much to be desired, the ideas are good. the performances help create tension. there isn't an abundance of death and destruction in the film--there's more of an abundance of home repair nightmares. but neither menace is really the point.<br /><br />the point is human relationships. there are a number of character arcs that are very interesting. the house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it. that it's in a posh neighborhood, and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies, shows that these problems do not only afflict those who can place blame with some external woe, such as money or health problems. peter's character evolves from a striving corporate employee with ""normal"" work-based friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive, scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful. at the same time, we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be. julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown, but finally finds liberation when she liberates herself from her failing romantic relationship.<br /><br />although 13 gantry row never quite transcends its made-for-television clunkiness, as a tv movie, this is a pretty good one, with admirable ambitions. anyone fond of haunted house films, psycho films or horror/thrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy. it certainly isn't worth spending $30 for a dvd (that was the price my local pbs station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it (factoring in shipping and handling)), but it's worth a rental, and it's definitely worth watching for free."	0
"daniell steel's daddy, what a refreshing story. this movie glorified the importance of the family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children. how rare is that? in these times of ""heather has two mommies"" (or what ever, you fill in the blanks) it is easy to see why this theme is not for everyone. with the father's roles being prominent i was hoping this would be another daniell steel saga. how disappointing to have it end. every character was important and did a fabulous job carrying their role. i would have loved to see each character develop over the years. i loved this movie, it is one i will defiantly watch every time it's on. good story, good acting, and i hope this isn't a spoiler, but no obtrusive sex or bad language. yes it touched my heart. warning, get the kleenex ready. what i find sad is that this side of family life is rarely depicted today in our entertainment, be it television or. movie's. daniell if your listening, you go girl, give us more."	0
"it's heart-warming to see a movie that doesn't bash males. in this one the wife/mother leaves her family to ""get in touch"" with herself - or pursue her libido. the father stays with and nurtures the kids, letting neither his work nor his love life interfere with his love of and responsibility to them."	0
"i must admit, when i read the description of the genre on netflix as ""steamy romance"" i was a little bit skeptical. ""steamy""? in a movie from 1968?? i was prepared for disappointment. and when i realized it was shot entirely in black & white, i knew my erotic hopes were dashed.<br /><br />boy, was i wrong! not only does this film have all of the elements of a steamy romance -- the discovery of first love, fear of the secret being found out, a sudden unexpected end -- but at times this movie was downright erotic. you will soon forget that it is shot in black & white. the cinematography deserves every accolade it has received over the years. and the performances from the two stars (essy persson and anna gael) are intense and memorable. ok, so they're both in their mid twenties trying to play school girls. it's 1968. do you really expect teenagers from the '60s to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this? many adult women were still trying to come to grips with their sexuality back then. anyone looking for real teens here is expecting too much.<br /><br />i think this movie was way ahead of its time. the level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure; yet it still managed to leave a lot to the imagination, opting instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what we were shown.<br /><br />i have no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here. as for you straight guys who love watching lesbians in action: although it won't be all you expect, i don't think you'll be too, too disappointed."	0
this is a film.., not porn.<br /><br />this is a wonderful film!!! full of tender moments and memories!! a beautiful piece of work!!! excellent!!! for intelligent, viewers only!!!<br /><br />if you are a film lover. a romantic. a person who has loved deeply, this is your film!!!!<br /><br />it has a beautiful surreal quality. fine acting and directing. watching this film made me remember my first love.<br /><br />thi is a film for those who want to reflect on life, love and the meaning of loss.<br /><br />highly recommended for all film lovers.	0
"it was a serious attempt to show the developing sexuality of two schoolgirls and did not try to exploit its fact even by today's standards, the film is interesting and provocative <br /><br />therese and isabelle are both attending the same girl's school therese is energetic, intelligent, and becomes a mentor for the innocent, naive, sweet isabelle she guides her through a number of exotic experiences, including a trip through an exclusive brothel, into her first lesbian liaison, and indirectly into her first heterosexual experience <br /><br />the film does not exploit any sex, nor is there an abundance of nudity... the imagery is effective, but sometimes the camera lingers too long, and the story goes slowly <br /><br />the director, radley metzger, went on to make a number of explicit erotic films under the name of henry paris he always has extremely detailed stories, good acting, and very high standards of cinematography...<br /><br />artistically, however, this is perhaps his most complete his later attempts supplied for entertainment, whereas ""therese and isabelle"" was a study into the nature of youthful eroticism..."	0
we watched this in my women's health issues class to point out how women are treated inferior to men in many societies, and i absolutely loved this movie. i plan on trying to get a copy of it myself to watch. the story is very touching and i would recommend it to anyone. i am a fan of different cultures and this movie was just what i needed. this is a movie for the whole family despite its rating. this is a movie i will show to my children. the professor of our class meant for the movie to primarily be a too to educate about women, but this movie was more than that. it is one of those movies that will forever stick out in my mind and will be a favorite.	0
"i was going to bed with my gf last night, and while she was brushing her teeth, i flipped channels until i came across this chinese movie called the king of masks. at first i thought it was going to be a kung fu movie, so i started watching it, and then it immediately captured me in, and i had to finish it.<br /><br />the little girl in the movie was absolutely adorble. she was such a great actor for being so little. maybe the fact it was in chinese, so the english was dubbed made it harder for me to tell...but she really seemed to be in character perfectly. i felt so bad for the girl as she kept trying to please her ""boss"" but everything just turned out rotten. lol. even when she brings him another grandson, just so he can pass on his art...it turns out that kid was kidnapped, so he gets arrested and has 5 days to live. lol...whatever she touches in an effort to be nice to her grandpa, just backfires.<br /><br />in the end, he sees how much love is in her and teaches her the art of masks...which is just so heartwarming after all the mishaps in the movie.<br /><br />definitely a gem, and totally original.<br /><br />scott"	0
"i admit to being somewhat jaded about the movie genre of a young child softening the heart of his/her reluctant guardian. i've seen enough of them  baby boom, kolya, about a boy, mostly martha, and to some extent, whale rider  to expect to be bored by the formula. what held my attention in the king of masks was the grimness of the setting: small-town china in the 1930's. extreme poverty was the norm, and girl children were considered so worthless to poor parents that they killed them at birth or gave them to whomever would take them on the black market. when wang discovers his purchased grandson, whom he's nicknamed ""doggie,"" is a granddaughter, he initially casts her out, even though she's showed great promise as street-performing heir. even after he reluctantly takes her back, he's not too upset when she's kidnapped. the film is gritty then, showing the lengths to which a young, street-smart girl had to go to survive in that society.<br /><br />the two lead performances are believable and beguiling in their societal context. in a western society, one would expect at least a hint of resentment from wang at not having achieved more material success. wang so thoroughly accepts his station as a celebrated artist with low societal status, though, that i did, too. while doggie exhibits a level of precociousness and cunning that would be suspect in a modern, suburban child, it's completely believable in the context of a kid constantly in survival mode in a society that treats poor girls like garbage. and after learning that her previous seven owners have physically and mentally abused her, her fierce attachment to wang makes perfect sense.<br /><br />the peek at small-town life in a foreign country, the naturalness of the two lead actors, the surprising plot twists, and of course, the heartwarming resolution all contribute to a very watchable film."	0
"this movie is the best film ever. i can't remember the last time a movie has drawn tears out of me. with a tear in my eye, i admire this movie. it has all the elements that a good movie must have: excellent dialogues, music, acting, story/plot. a story of friendship, courage, kindliness and loyalty between a street performing who famous to the king of masks and a little girl that sold as a boy in serf bazaar. little girl liked to be his granddaughter and king of masks liked a grandson. they were not conventional in real. every scene they were together was priceless. the camera work is flawless and grips you. the acting is inspired. xu zhu was excellent as the king of masks. renying zhou ""doggie"" looks pretty and played her character very well. zhigang zhao as liang sao lang was great. he played his helpful and kindhearted character extremely well. if you have't this movie, try it once, do watch it."	0
verhoeven's movie was utter and complete garbage. he's a disgusting hack of a director and should be ashamed. by his own admission, he read 2 chapters of the book, got bored, and decided to make the whole thing up from scratch.<br /><br />heinlein would have never supported that trash if he'd been alive to see it. it basically steals the name, mocks politics of the book (which is a good portion of it), and throws in some t&a so the average idiot american moviegoer doesn't get bored.<br /><br />this anime isn't perfect, but it's at least mostly accurate, as best i can tell.	0
wang bianlian is an old street performer who is known as a 'king of masks' for his mastery of sichuan change art. liang is a famous opera performer of sichuan art and respects wang as an artist and as a person. liang is worried that a precious art shouldn't die with wang and so he sows the seed of an heir in to wang's mind. the film is about prejudices, male domination, state of art, values and most importantly warmth.<br /><br />i can't recommend this film enough. the whole film is in loops. everything has a significance. its a long story which has been edited so well that the length of the film is just 91 minutes. a total satisfaction. for five minutes it is an artistic film, next five minutes its a sad film, next five minutes its a thriller. it just keeps changing its mood like its protagonist changes his face. last scene on the rope is phenomenal. story and script is flawless. actors are brilliant. both the protagonists are artists you can tell the way they have performed. very impressive. it was not even nominated for oscars. that year 'english patient' got the best film oscar and in the foreign film category 'kolya' won. 'kolya' was just ok and about 'english patient' the lesser said the better. watch it 9/10.	0
one of the most heart-warming foreign films i've ever seen.<br /><br />the young girl is an amazing talent. stellar performances by her (doggie), the old man (the king of masks), and liang (the living boddhisatva).<br /><br />(spoiler) the deplorable treatment of children, especially females is disturbing.<br /><br />loved the music. the original chinese dialog heightens the emotional intensity of the performances and the story.<br /><br />this is a must see -- enjoyable family film, although not for very young children. would have rated the dvd release even higher if the soundtrack had been transferred better onto the dvd and the transfer had included the widescreen version.	0
wow. what a wonderful film. the script is nearly perfect it appears this is the only film written by minglun wei,i hope he has more stories in him.<br /><br />the acting is sublime. renying zhou as doggie was amazing -- very natural talent, and xu zhu was a delight - very believable as the jaded old traditionalist. <br /><br />the soundtrack was very effective, guiding without being overwhelming. <br /><br />if only more movies like this were made whether in hollywood or hong kong- a family friendly, well acted, well written, well directed, near perfect gem.	0
the filming is pleasant and the environment is keenly realistic. i liked that it boldly redresses conceptions of the many difficult moral and social morays of the 1930's chinese-mainland countryside as well as more basic human questions - i felt i could get a real sense of the times, recreated even in splendid shots of traditional chinese theatre and in purist depictions of street living. it seemed worthwhile to experience. the interwoven role which buddhism plays is probably the most true-to-form - both in its menial and in its philosophic aspect, perhaps the most effective that i've seen in chinese film. casting is great. images are memorable. acting is solid enough. thematically puerile but still rich enough to compliment the vehicle of its expression.	0
the king of masks is a beautifully told story that pits the familial gender preference towards males against human preference for love and companionship. set in 1930s china during a time of floods, we meet wang, an elderly street performer whose talents are magical and capture the awe of all who witness him. when a famous operatic performer sees and then befriends wang, he invites wang to join their troupe. however, we learn that wang's family tradition allows him only to pass his secrets to a son. learning that wang is childless, wang is encouraged to find an heir before the magic is lost forever. taking the advice to heart, wang purchases an 8 year old to fulfill his legacy; he would teach his new son, doggie, the ancient art of silk masks. soon, wang discovers a fact about doggie that threatens the rare and dying art.<br /><br />together, wang and doggie create a bond and experience the range of emotions that invariably accompany it. the story is absorbing. the setting is serene and the costuming simple. summarily, it is an international award winning art film which can't help but to move and inspire.	0
this is a superb movie, suitable for all but the very youngest, though accessibility for younger people was marred (at least in the print which i saw) by the use of some unfortunate choice of english sub-titling! for much of the film it is almost impossible to guess in which time-period it is set - there is no modern technology shown, not even the ubiquitous chinese bicycle, just a drab, almost monochrome, everyday life, against which is contrasted the dazzling display of the sezuan opera and of celebratory fireworks. even when a group of soldiers refer to their imminent departure for a theatre of war, this could still be any time in the past 150 years.<br /><br />but then we briefly see a motor car - late 30s, early 40s style - and we realise that we are watching a china on the verge of huge upheavals, and that much of the world we are seeing is about to be swept away in the cataclysm of world war 2 and the communist revolution.<br /><br />which makes the central character's desire to adhere to old customs and traditions all the more poignant.<br /><br />but the film also raises issues which are of vital importance even today, both within china and in other parts of the world: the inequality between boys and girls, men and women; the trade, for various purposes, in young children; corruption in society; injustice; the importance of friendship.<br /><br />maybe i'm reading too much into this film; but i don't think so! i also think that it is a scandal that films of this calibre are often not shown in the united kingdom, whilst dross is passed off as quality material.<br /><br />but don't get me started on that...	0
king of masks (bian lian in china) is a shockingly beautiful and profoundly touching film. winner of 16 awards from around the world, this film based on a true story centers on wang bianlian, a street performer in 1930s china who is growing older but has no heir to pass on his art of face-change opera. he has a unique talent of quickly changing masks in performance, and no one knows how he does it. he has a longing desire to have a grandson, as his art is a family heirloom that can only be passed on to a male heir. we then go to the streets, and see that people are selling their children because they can't afford to take care of them: some are even begging to take their daughters for free, because daughters are not worth much in this society. wang bianlian's story goes on from there.<br /><br />the film was so astonishingly good, the acting was amazing, and the issues were so weighty and well-addressed. there is the gender inequality and the depressing fact that in this time and place, no one wants a little girl. also interesting to note is that the famed opera actor who always plays a woman and is known as the living bodhisattva is a man who dresses as a woman, and while he is famous and well-respected, he regards himself as something low, a half woman. as we go further into the film, the face the issues of human slave trade and its demand and thus the lack of a possible solution for it, the brutality and corruption of the military and police, and the helplessness and lack of power any individual can face due to unfortunate events or even good intentions.<br /><br />this is definitely one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life, and xu zhu, the actor who plays wang bianlian, presents yet another beautiful performance.	0
this is how movies are supposed to be made: a fascinating setting; characters about whom you come to care deeply; writing and editing that move the plot efficiently and build suspense. this is a wonderful film -- deeply moving without being sentimental. highly recommended.	0
this movie was excellent. a sad truth to how culture tends to clash with the sexes. this is just one big warm fuzzy type of movie. you have the master who is steeped in tradition and kind hearted in his own way, doggie despite being a girl thing to win his affections and you top it off with one cute monkey with a thousand facial expressions. this equals on big happy movie in the end. this movie does a good job at showing how steeped in tradition one can be, so steeped that they are willing to die without sharing their secrets. you see sides to a culture never seen before which helps enhance the drama that unfolds near the end of the picture. the cinema-photography is excellent, in particular the opening parade sequence with all the sparkers. bound to be in oscar contention for best foreign film.	0
robert a. heinlein's classic novel starship troopers has been messed around with in recent years, in everything to paul verhoeven's 1997 film to a tv series, to a number of games. but none of these, so to speak, has really captured the spirit of his novel. the games are usually unrelated, the tv series was more of a spin off, and the less said about verhoeven's film, the better. little do most know, however, that in japan, an animated adaptation had already been done, released the year of heinlein's death. and, believe it or not, despite its differences, this 6-part animated series is, plot-wise, the most faithful adaptation of heinlein's classic.<br /><br />the most obvious plus to this series is the presence of the powered armor exoskeletons, something we were deprived of in verhoeven's film. like the book, the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on action and space travel, though we see a fair amount of each. while events happen differently than in the book, the feel of the book's plot is present. rico and carmen have a romantic entanglement, but it's only slightly more touched upon than in the book. while some may believe the dialogue and character interaction to be a bit inferior to the book (it gets a bit of the anime treatment, but what did you expect?), but it's far superior to the film. heinlein's political views are merely excised, as opposed to the film, where they are reversed. the big payoff of the series, however, is the climatic battle on klendathu between the troopers and the bugs/aliens, which features the kind of action from the powered armor suits we would have like to have seen in a film version.<br /><br />overall, i enjoyed this series because i wanted to see a vision closer to that of heinlein. and i think they did pretty well with this. if you can find this series, give it a look.	0
as i was watching this film on video last night, i kept getting these tingles that told me this one will endure. i've a feeling i'll be watching this again and again for years to come.<br /><br />it's got all the timeless qualities you could ask for in a story/film. and even though some cultural references are obscure for me, a western viewer, at the core this is a universal tale.	0
"when tradition dictates that an artist must pass his great skills and magic on to an heir, the aging and very proud street performer, known to all as ""the king of masks,"" becomes desperate for a young man apprentice to adopt and cultivate.<br /><br />his warmth and humanity, tho, find him paying a few dollars for a little person displaced by china's devastating natural disasters, in this case, massive flooding in the 1930's.<br /><br />he takes his new, 7 year old companion, onto his straw houseboat, to live with his prized and beautiful monkey, ""general,"" only to discover that the he-child is a she-child.<br /><br />his life is instantly transformed, as the love he feels for this little slave girl becomes entwined in the stupifying tradition that requires him to pass his art on only to a young man.<br /><br />there are many stories inside this one...many people are touched, and the culture of china opens itself for our western eye to observe. thousands of years of heritage boil down into a teacup of drama, and few will leave this dvd behind with a dry eye.<br /><br />the technical transfer itself is not that great, as i found the sound levels all over the meter, and could actually see the video transfer lines in several parts of the movie. highly recommended :-) 9/10 stars."	0
"an unexpected pleasure as i had heard nothing about this film.<br /><br />shameful since it warrants having a wider audience.<br /><br />a wonderfully humane story with a social message gently told, although admittedly predictable in its resolution. solidly acted by the principals. beautifully photographed with muted colors floating against grey that captures the nostalgic tone of the film.<br /><br />my recent foray into chinese film (shower, the road home, not one less) has been an exciting one that i hope to continue exploring. china and its people is an amazing canvas for film-makers. ""the king of masks"" can be highly recommended as a starting point for anyone similarly interested in recent chinese film.<br /><br />"	0
one of the great things about many of the superb chinese movies you can find, if you are lucky, in the video stores, is they are very accurate retellings of actual, true stories. farewell, my concubine, the emperor and the assassin and this movie are perfect examples. the film makers take a true story and work hard to accurately create a movie without compromising the facts for dramatic or commercial convenience -- the hallmark of much hollywood, and especially disney films.<br /><br />in this story we follow the later years of an famous local street performer dubbed the king of masks for his mastery of sichuan change art. along an having lost his only son many years earlier, he searches to find a male heir to carry on his rare and dying art in a society that forbids females to have such work. master wang is sold a son by a slave trader. all is well as he joyfully prepares to pass down his art. but the son eventually is found out to be a girl. from there, the story get very interesting, with a good performance by master liang of the sichuan opera -- a regional operatic style related to peking opera. fans of farewell my concubine should look carefully at master liang's portrayal of a male playing the female role in chinese opera. it may help them come to understand that the players of these female roles were probably not homosexuals or castrati, but people who have be so psychologically conditioned as to be totally unaware of their own sexuality.	0
"quote by nicolas martin (nicmart) from houston, tx: ""fine film, but dvd ""reformatted for tv"", 8 april 2002 - this is a charming and emotive film. on the other hand, the dvd i purchased has been ""reformatted to fit your tv"" by the clods at columbia tristar. there is no excuse for not providing the film in widescreen format, except that hollywood treats all films like the moronic, disposable trash that it is so used to producing. what a shame.""<br /><br />what a (criminal!) shame indeed. however, there is another version out though. see here for details http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/dvdcompare2/kingofmasks.htm<br /><br />wonderful performances by the two main actors (the king and doggie) btw."	0
"masks"" is a moving film that works on many levels. at its simplest, it is the haunting story of a street performer who bonds with a young child while trying to pass along his creative art (masks) to the next generation. although, at times the story makes the old man into a job, it is so well crafted (written, acted, directed, wonderful production values), it is easy to move beyond his plight. and, if you hang with it, the film is ultimately very sweet and uplifting. kudos all around. this is a wonderful film for children as well as adults. the trick is how to get americans who may not like foreign language films to see it!	0
beautiful and touching movie. rich colors, great settings, good acting and one of the most charming movies i have seen in a while. i never saw such an interesting setting when i was in china. my wife liked it so much she asked me to log on and rate it so other would enjoy too.	0
this is probably my favorite movie of all time. it is perfection in its storytelling. it will break your heart not because it's over sentimental but because you will truly feel every emotion these characters go through. you feel for doggie because of the hopeless situation that existed for young girls in china at that time.	0
it's a tale that could have taken place anywhere really, given the right circumstances. street entertainer catching the attention of famous opera star and friendship ensuing. the aging entertainer finds/buys a male child to pass his art to. from there, we follow them through the rigors of their challenging, but free life along the river. traveling town to town, he performs and has some degree of notoriety. despite the times and the influences, the man is kind and good.<br /><br />overall, the performances are first rate, especially xu zhu, who portrays the street performer. the child (renying zhou) is beautiful, and downright strong, and withstands the overt prejudices well. the two protagonists, along with supporting help from the kind opera singer, master liang (an interestingly androgynous zhao zhigang), paint a very interesting tale of forgiveness, sadness and love. some have mentioned this film's remote similarities to ba wang bie ji (farewell my concubine); yet this film can't stand easily on its own, any resemblance is remote at best.<br /><br />my only qualm with the king of masks, is the ending. it was weak, cliche and about as subtle as a sledgehammer. the audience was already wrapped up in the story, what was the needless manipulation for? what a shame. to bring a fine motion picture that far, only to surrender to emotional (and corny) pathos like that. it frankly made this film good, instead of the classic, it should've been. that aside, the king of masks is still very well worth your time. i was happy to see the shaw brothers are still producing good films. highly recommended.	0
i enjoyed the cinematographic recreation of china in the 1930s in this beautiful film. the story is simple. an older male performer wants to pass on his art to a young man although he has no living children. the faces of the actors are marvelous to see. the story reveals the devotion and gratitude of children to those who treat them well and their longing to be treated well. the operas in the film remind me of farewell my concubine, which was more sophisticated and intricate. the story here reminds me of a dickens tale of days when children were almost chattel. the plot is a bit predictable and a bit too sentimental for me but well worth the time to view for the heroism, humanity, and history portrayed.	0
ok, let's get this clear. i'm really not into sci-fi, but for some reason i love stargate sg-1. <br /><br />jack o'neil takes his team sg-1 through a stargate. a round device that creates a wormhole. it gives you the ability to travel to distant worlds. it might sound like your usual sci-fi-series, but it's not! the plot is set today not in some distant millennium like many other sci-fi-series. i find that great. it gives you things, happenings and such you can relate to, and you can jump into the series at any time without having to learn many new terms and names of all the gadgets. they have some of course but thanks to o'neil who likes to keep a simple terminology, there's not many. <br /><br />the series has a nice blending of action, humor and drama. if you enjoy loads of special effects you're not going to find it here. they don't use many bad ones but a limited amount of well made special effects.	0
in the rapid economic development of 1990's in china, there is a resurgence of traditional chinese culture, partially due to the rise of nationalism accompanied by the increase in wealth, and more importantly, due to the sense of spiritual belonging after the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the post cultural-revolutionary era.<br /><br />however, the resurgence of chinese traditional culture, namely, the confucianism, was not without disasters, because chinese are adopted the entire tradition without eliminating the bad part, and the discrimination against girls demonstrated in this film is an excellent example.<br /><br />moreover, not only the part that should be discarded were inherited, the good part that was supposed to be inherited, such as the traditional opera, and its technique, such as changing face, was ignored in the resurgence, and facing extinction.<br /><br />the director used this film to criticize the problem of re-embracing tradition by contemporary china and this is the deeper meaning behind the movie.	0
this is a beautiful, rich, and very well-executed film with a rich and meaningful story. basically, it tells how an old master story teller needs to find a (male) heir to carry on his craft, but ends up not getting what he expected in his very male-dominated world. the characters must then deal with their situation and the old master must grapple with the conflict between his desire for a companion and heir and his and society's traditional notions.<br /><br />the story is fun, emotional, and complex. the exploration of the characters, their lives, and emotions, is rich and compelling the character development is strong while the characters are complex and not one dimensional at all. the film expertly conveys the old man's emotions and his desire to find an heir, and compellingly shows how he and the kid handle the situation. there is also humour, sometimes quite subtle, at appropriate points. the film also examines the good and bad of traditional chinese culture, creating further interest and depth to the film.<br /><br />the directing, acting, and scenery are all outstanding. added to the other strengths, this creates rich and convincing visual images and compelling, real characters. as a result, the film evokes strong empathy for, and feelings about, the characters.<br /><br />some have claimed that the ending weakens the film, but i do not necessarily agree. perhaps it could have been stronger with a different ending, but any improvement in the overall film would have been rather small.	0
the movie is truly poignant, unique and uplifting. the story is universal in that it's a battle between good, evil and the world between. the most important thing is that its rating is wrong, misleading, and a travesty. blockbuster has it rated as though it were an x rated movie. the truth is is that it is closer to g than pg and should be seen by children who can read the clear and simple sub-titles.	0
the fact that this film was put out on dvd still formatted-to tv and with a fuzzy picture really annoyed a lot of film purists......and rightly so. this deserves a lot better treatment.<br /><br />the story is about a street performer who needs a son to pass on his craft (the rules of the day) and winds up with a little girl instead (not the conventional way) ....and the problems that ensue afterward. the old man had bought the kid at a slave auction and soon discovers the kid is not a boy, which he obviously thought was the case.<br /><br />the old man ""bianlian wang (xu zhu)is kind of funny-looking with a missing front tooth and an infectious grin. the little girl ""doggie"" (zhou renying) is a cutie. the rest of the story is how the two manage after that. i usually like a nice sentimental ending but this gets a bit carried away in the final 15 minutes.<br /><br />overall, it's involving story complete with drama, suspense, humor and sadness. just don't expect a good quality picture for the money you are spending on the dvd. until it comes out on widescreen, rent it.	0
this spectacular film is one of the most amazing movies i have ever seen. it shows a china i had never seen or imagined, and i believe it shows 1930's china in the most real light ever seen in a movie. it is absolutely heart-breaking in so many situations, seeing how hard life was for the characters, and yet the story and the ending are incredibly joyful. you truly see the depths and heigths of human existence in this film. the actors are all perfect, such that you feel like you have really entered a different world. <br /><br />i simply can not recommend this movie highly enough. it may just change you forever once you have seen it.	0
i just saw this movie today with my children (son, 10 and daughter, 4.5) at the 3rd annual roger ebert overlooked film festival. after the film the children in the audience were allowed to ask questions to the director, tian-ming wu. he (through a translator) told several stories about his life and the making of the film.<br /><br />all tangents aside, both of my children really enjoyed this movie. of course, i had to paraphrase many of the subtitles for my daughter, but much of the film is visually self-explanatory.<br /><br />i won't give anything away, but the bottom line is that this film is so much better than 95% of the hollywood crap (especially children's films) out there.<br /><br />cheers.<br /><br />p.s. there is a ""real""/original king of masks who can/could do 12 masks at once. the actor in the movie trained and learned to do up to 4 masks at a time (then they would cut and change to 4 new masks).	0
fabulous costumes by edith head who painted them on liz taylor at her finest!<br /><br />the sfx are very good for a movie of its age, and the stunt doubles actually looked like the actors, even down to body type, a rarity in movies of this vintage.<br /><br />a cozy movie, with splendid panoramas -- even when chopped down to pan and scan.	0
elephant walk (1954) starring an early peter finch as lord of the manor in some god-forsaken plantation where there is always the danger of elephants or mad englishmen, staying out in the midday sun and going berserk. well eventually they do, after the typhoid or cholera outbreak, of course, and much mayhem ensues. taylor replaced an ailing vivien leigh in this pot boiler/adventure flick. when the elephants storm the house and trap liz on the grand staircase i still get goose bumps. thank goodness dana andrews is around to save the day. one of my favorite guilty pleasures. in color too!	0
. . . or type on a computer keyboard, they'd probably give this eponymous film a rating of ""10."" after all, no elephants are shown being killed during the movie; it is not even implied that any are hurt. to the contrary, the master of elephant walk, john wiley (peter finch), complains that he cannot shoot any of the pachyderms--no matter how menacing--without a permit from the government (and his tone suggests such permits are not within the realm of probability). furthermore, the elements conspire--in the form of an unusual drought and a human cholera epidemic--to leave the wiley plantation house vulnerable to total destruction by the elephant people (as the natives dub them) to close the story. if you happen to see the current release earth, you'll detect the elephant people are faring less well today.	0
i got in to this excellent program in about season 4 and since then i have seen all the episodes got all the episodes on dvd and keeps getting better and better with the seasons of 9 and 10. it now may not have richard dean anderson now but the addition of ben browder and claudie black it has still given the show more strength and original still even after 10 seasons. sadly now the sci-fi channel got rid of this amazing show with no hope relay for a 11 season there are making two direct to dvd movie and hopefully more. atlantis is still going strong on its 4th seasons. and there is a third spin off in the works the stargate franchise is nowhere near dead. this tv show is a must see for all sci-fi fans and people of genres because this has such a wide range of things to appeal to all ages and all types of people watch it !!!!! 10/10	0
i was prepared for a turgid talky soap opera cum travelogue, but was pleased to find a fast-paced script, an underlying moral, excellent portrayals from all the actors, especially peter finch, amazing special effects, suspense, and beautiful cinematography--there's even a shot of the majestic stone buddhas recently destroyed by the taliban. not to mention elizabeth taylor at her most gloriously beautiful and sympathetic, before she gave in to the gaspy hysterics that marred her later work. all the supporting players round it out, and i do wonder who trained all those elephants.<br /><br />speaking of the stone-buddha sequence, you really can discern that it's vivien leigh in the long shots. her shape and the way she moves is distinct from taylor's. the only thing marring that sequence are the poorly done process shots, where the background moves by much too fast for horses at a walk.<br /><br />if you want a thought-provoking film that is beautiful to watch and never boring, spend a few hours with elephant walk.	0
i watched ""elephant walk"" for the first time in about 30 years and was struck by how similar the story line is to the greatly superior ""rebecca."" as others have said, you have the sweet young thing swept off her feet by the alternately charming and brooding lord of the manor, only to find her marriage threatened by the inescapable memory of a larger-than-life yet deeply flawed relative. you have the stern and disapproving servant, a crisis that will either bind the couple together or tear them irreparably apart, climaxed by the fiery destruction of the lavish homestead.<br /><br />meanwhile, ""elephant walk"" also owes some of its creepy jungle atmosphere to ""the letter,"" the bette davis love triangle set on a singapore rubber plantation rather than a sri lankan tea plantation.<br /><br />maltin gives ""elephant walk"" just two stars, and imdb readers aren't much kinder, but i enjoyed it despite its predictability. elizabeth taylor never looked lovelier, and peter finch does a credible job as the basically good man unable to shake off the influence of his overbearing father. dana andrews -- a favorite in ""laura"" and ""the best year of our lives"" -- is wasted as elizabeth's frustrated admirer. the real star is the bungalow, one of the most beautiful interior sets in movie history.	0
the scintillating elizabeth taylor stars in this lesser-known classic as a young girl from london who falls in love with a tea plantation owner from british ceylon (current day sri lanka). upon arrival she instantly feels out of place and is forced to adapt to the new culture as well as be in constant awareness of the angry elephant herd. william dieterle, who also directed the life of emile zola and portrait of jennie , does a masterful job of bringing a somewhat dark, and almost eerie, undertone to this romance and the setting is one of the most beautiful i've seen with the black and white themed mansion and the gorgeous island scenery.	0
a beautiful shopgirl in london is swept off her feet by a millionaire tea plantation owner and soon finds herself married and living with him at his villa in british ceylon. although based upon the book by robert standish, this initial set-up is highly reminiscent of hitchock's ""rebecca"", with leading lady elizabeth taylor clashing with the imposing chief of staff at the mansion and (almost immediately) her own husband, who is still under the thumb of his deceased-but-dominant father. taylor, a last-minute substitute for an ailing vivien leigh, looks creamy-smooth in her high fashion wardrobe, and her performance is quite strong; however, once husband peter finch starts drinking heavily and barking orders at her, one might think her dedication to him rather masochistic (this feeling hampers the ending as well). still, the film offers a heady lot for soap buffs: romantic drama, a bit of travelogue, interpretive dance, an elephant stampede, and a perfectly-timed outbreak of cholera! *** from ****	0
elephant walk may not be the acme of literature or of film, but it is great entertainment in the quasi-melodramatic mode. it is the story of love, both genuine and illicit, as well as overweening ambition, devotion, and the arrogance of personal tyranny. a previous reviewer, john mankin, questions why the central focus of the film, the mansion called elephant walk, should have been built by the former owner, the ""governor"" the late tom wiley, right across the elephants' traditional path to the major source of water, the river. to miss this point is to essentially miss the point of the whole center of the film: the hubris of man. that his son, played by peter finch, should become enthralled by the super image and enigma of his revered father, is not unexpected, since the son was without a mother growing up in a foreign jungle with only his father and his father's rowdy 'boys' club' as his role models. the point of the father was that he was a self-made man who would tame nature to his liking, and that liking was not just a tea plantation upon the lands the elephants once dominated, but also that he would dominate even the large bull elephant that led the herd, and thus he would dominate his son and all around him, and so we join the tale after the elephants have been denied the crucial dry season access to their pathway to water. who could know that this dry season would last so long and what the elephants would do in desperation to get water? this is the nexus of the film: what will animals do to get water; what will humans do to get power or love? ceylon, today's sri lanka, is the huge island off the coast of india where the plantation is located and one quickly learns that it is the real scenery of the story, not just the expenses of miss taylor. were it not for this exotic location (much of the film was shot in ceylon), and the magnificent ""bungalow"" this would have been just another potboiler. one must recognize the atmosphere created here as integral to the time and place, as it illuminates the latter day wealth and power attained by the english immigrant 'conquerors' that were part and parcel of the british raj. it is only such wealth gained by the use of virtual slave labor that one could build so magnificent a residence of ebony, teak, and marble. not to be overlooked are the wonderfully carved jalees (grille work window and doorway borders) evidently specified by art directors j. mcmillan johnson and hal pereira and obviously made by the cheaper labor on the island. such craftsmanship reveals the careful attention to detail that these men sought.<br /><br />for those immune to the blandishments of time, place, and architecture, there is always the allure of miss taylor, as she marries a man she doesn't really know and is tacitly wooed by a another man, against the background described, and under the overarching tyranny of the legacy of a man deceased. as i said, it is not great literature nor even great film, but it is great spectacle long before that term was debased by the special effects extravaganzas of today.<br /><br />this is one of those films made to be seen on the giant screen of an outdoor drive-in, not on the home tv, so arrange the largest screen to see it on to fully appreciate its fine camera-work and scope.	0
my parents took me to this movie when i was nine years old. i have never forgotten it. i had never before seen anything as beautiful as elizabeth taylor. (she was twenty-two when she made elephant walk) remember, i'm nine, so the feelings aren't sexual, i just couldn't see anything else on the screen. i just wanted to sit at her feet like a puppy and stare up at her. she has begun to show her age, (she's almost seventy-four) but i still believe her to be one of the most beautiful and breathtaking women to ever have lived.<br /><br />i have seen the movie several times since, and it is a sappy melodrama. what saves it is, of course, miss taylor's beauty, magnificent scenery, the very impressive elephant stampede, and a well-made point on human arrogance in the face of nature.<br /><br />all in all, a well-spent couple of hours watching the movie channel or a rented video.	0
robert standish's novel is about a triangular romantic situation on a ceylonese tea plantation... so the events of the ceylon backgrounds and pictorial beauty are rewarding points to william dieterle's film...<br /><br />the story is about a rich powerful planter (peter finch), who brings a charming and tender beauty (elizabeth taylor), into the jungle as his bride... the plantation, of course, is endangered by some kind of wild life... for this reason taylor  elegant as never in dazzling costumes  finds herself in a strange atmosphere... the echo determination of a ghost, the bad temper of a husband obsessed by the memory of his autocratic father, a highly dangerous disease, and the fury of wild animals...<br /><br />in her confusion, boredom and annoyance elizabeth taylor looks to a friendly face, a pretentious foreman (dana andrews), who admires her beauty but tries to conquer her love...<br /><br />with echoes of ""jane eyre,"" the mysterious yorkshire mansion with a brooding master, and ""rebecca,"" the innocent young second wife hunted by the image of the glamorous first wife, ""elephant walk"" is a menace melodrama with a wide view of a huge tropical bungalow, exotic dances with rage excessively colorful, stampeding big bull elephants, amazing mansion set on fire, all in the company of an exquisite creature with an unquestioned beauty and talent...<br /><br />the movie gave liz a change of scenery, and allowed her more creative energy and self-respect than most of her other willful debutante-rebels the wife here has a sharp tongue and a strong will, and so taylor plays her movie star heroine with more spirit than she was given credit for	0
one of the first ova's (""original video animation"") i ever bought, this still has to be one of my favourite anime titles. a cyberpunk sci-fi action comedy set against an unlikely (for a comedy, that is) background of near-future pollution in a dystopian society.<br /><br />the ""heroes"" of dominion are the tank police, formed with a ""if we can't beat crime, we'll get bigger guns"" philosophy, and who are, like the name suggests, patrolling the city in tanks instead of patrol cars, and who are actually far more dangerous than any criminals they are trying to catch. most, if not all, of these cops are borderline(?) psychopaths and neurotics, giving new meaning to the phrase ""loose cannons"".<br /><br />equally colourful and amusing are their adversaries, terrorist buaku and his hench(wo)men, the twin cat sisters, whose existence always seems to involve giving the tank police a hard time.<br /><br />the animation is not state of the art, but it's very nice otherwise; the colourful palette and cartoonish look of the characters and mecha fit nicely with the comedic atmosphere of dominion.<br /><br />the english dubbing is, again, lots of fun. the soundtrack of the english version is also very good. i wonder if they ever made a soundtrack album of that...<br /><br />anyway, dominion tank police is great. it's japanese cyberpunk sf with lots of comedy, filled with completely over-the-top characters and situations, making sure that it never takes itself seriously. highly recommended.	0
dominion tank police is without a shell of a doubt, one of the most amazing shows ever produced, but not just in the field of animation. while the first part (acts 1 and 2) mostly consists of action and fun, the second part is more serious and one should not treat the second part in the exact same way as first part. the subtleties are truly out of this world and the characterization is beyond brilliant. you must have an extra degree of intelligence to appreciate the intricacies of the second part (acts-3 and 4). i do have some complaints though. in the first part, the tank bonaparte quite literally jumps over a tank shell and it did not make any sense at all. one might also question the plausibility of bonaparte jumping on the wing of helicopter gunship even though it was cool. buaku rules.	0
the anime that got me hooked on anime...<br /><br />set in the year 2010 (hey, that's not too far away now!) the earth is now poison gas wasteland of pollution and violence. seeing as how crimes are happening ever 30 seconds are so and committed by thieves who have the fire power of third world terrorists, the government of the fictional new port city form the tank police to deal with the problem - cops with tanks! oh the insanity!<br /><br />the ""heroes"" of this series include the new recruit leona ozaki, a red haired japanese woman (yeah i know, they never match their distinctly japanese names with a japanese appearance) who has just been drafted into the tank police and is quickly partnered with blond, blue eyed nice guy al. leona is new at using tanks and unfortunately she destroys the favorite tank of tank police commander charles britain (also known as ""brenten""), a big guy who looks like tom selleck on steroids and sporting a pair of nifty sunglasses, a big revolver and a bad temper. britain didn't like having leona join the tank police in the first place and her wrecking his tiger special (a giant green monster tank) doesn't exactly endear her to him, nor is he fond of her taking the remains of his giant tank and using it to build a mini-tank that she nicknames bonaparte and he is soon pushing to have her transferred to child welfare ""where the boys are more your size"" as he puts it. there's also specs, the bifocal genius, bible quoting/god fearing chaplain, purple mo-hawked mohican, and the pot bellied chief, who's right on the edge thanks to the mayor always yelling at him about the tank police antics. seeing as how the tank cops often destroy half the city while chasing the bad guys and use extreme violence to capture them, they're not very well liked by the people.<br /><br />the ""villains"" are a cyborg named buaku who's got a mysterious past that's connected with a project known as ""green peace"", his gang and his two sexy cat cyborg sidekicks anna & uni puma. in the first installment these guys are being paid to steal urine samples from a hospital treating people who haven't been infected by the poison gas clouds and in the 2nd they're hired to steal a painting that is of a naked buaku. the story, however, was uncompleted in the anime and was finished up in a cult comic (""manga"") book that's very hard to find.<br /><br />all sorts of chaos and mayhem ensue in this black comic venture that examines how far people want their police to go in order to catch criminals and what happens when the fine line between good guys and bad guys starts to get blurred. this is the kind of thing that if you were going to make a movie of it, you'd better go get quentin tarantino. uneven in places but still a lot of fun.<br /><br />followed by ""new dominion: tank police"".	0
fact: stargate sg-1 is a cheesy sci-fi tv series.<br /><br />there's no escaping facts. how much you try to excuse yourself or explain it stargate sg-1 remains a cheesy sci-fi tv series.<br /><br />stargate sg-1 does borrow and steal ideas briskly. special fx aren't nearly as impressive as they could have been and the action isn't going to blow you out of the chair. or couch for that matter either.<br /><br />but, and this is where i really think stargate sg-1 deserves all the credit it can get, for each and every episode or stolen idea i think you can count at least one cheesy sci-fi movie that's actually worse than a one hour tv episode.<br /><br />in fact some episodes actually could probably have been 90 minutes long and still have been better than most movies.<br /><br />and being able to keep that quality throughout the show and keep delivering and pushing the storyline further is what makes stargate sg-1 special.<br /><br />i am very picky with my selections. i follow perhaps one or two tv series at most and i hold pretty high standards which made me even more surprised when i found myself caught.<br /><br />so for those who decide to brush of stargate sg-1 as yet another tacky sci-fi show, don't. stick with it and you'll see what i'm talking about.	0
scott bartlett's 'offon' is nine minutes of pure craziness. it is a full-frontal assault of psychedelic, pulsating, epilepsy-inducing flashing lights and colours, and the first true merging of film and video in avante-garde cinema. there's no story to speak of, but bartlett uses images of nature  particularly the human face and form  to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions, integrating these biological phenomena into the highly-industrial form of modern technology. in a sense, the film represents the merging of humanity into his tools, his machinery, his technology. this theme connects loosely with the subplot of hal9000 in stanley kubrick's '2001: a space odyssey (1968),' and, indeed, bartlett's opening sequence of images  flashing colours before a close-up human eye  recalls dave bowman's journey through the stargate. the visuals are richly-coloured, a confronting blend of sharp, vivid photography and increasingly-grainy video, as though we're sitting too close to a television screen {as a matter of fact, the end product was recorded from a tv monitor}.<br /><br />there appears to be some confusion about the film's release date. imdb lists the film as a 1972 release, but both the national film registry and the national film preservation foundation give 1968 as the correct year. perhaps this disparity reflects the time between the film's completion and its first public screening. either way, the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time, occasionally reminiscent of a 1980s music video, and some brisk techno music wouldn't have gone amiss, either! 'offon' captures grainy, fragmented images, presenting life from the warped perspective of a computer processing too much information. i had a thought  and please don't laugh at this free-thinking interpretation  that an extraterrestrial civilisation capturing earth's television signals might very well receive such a disjointed, alien documentation of human life, a bizarre montage of only vaguely-familiar imagery that couldn't possibly make any coherent sense. perhaps this is where mankind, with all his technology, is eventually heading, towards an irreversible merging of film and video, of purity and artificiality.	0
i stumbled across this (act-i) by pure dumb luck and this was more than a decade ago. this was'nt even what the cover label on the tape mentioned. it amazed me. it intimidated me. it shocked me. i eventually forgot about and almost a decade later, i happened to think about it again. then went and bought both acts. they were even better than i had experienced at first.<br /><br />my only complaint is that while the tank police keep on going on and on about being at war with crime, warranting tanks and heavy artillery, it would seem as though they are really having a hard time with criminals. that is either never shown or is simply a lie as they appear to be taking it easy most of the time. if that bit about being in a state of war was really propaganda, it certainly has not been shown as such.<br /><br />i don't think the original japanese version could have been any where as good as the americanized version of this. but regarding the story, there has certainly been some proper explanations lost in translation but it can be excused.	0
dominion tank police is an exercise in contradictive film making. the storyline across the 4 parts blends mindless action, slap-stick humor, touching humanity and thought provoking philosophical questions. it's hard to believe that there was only one director, as the style changes from episode to episode. a must-see movie for anyone who likes anime.	0
i absolutely loved this film! i do not at all relate to all the other comments i have read about it. i was completely enthralled through every second! <br /><br />i found the story gripping, the acting intense, and the direction spot-on. i would literally jump every time the phone would ring close to the end of the movie. even though there was nothing ""scary"" about the story itself, i was soundly on edge through the whole movie - and for the rest of my evening. <br /><br />i found that there were so many perfect choices made...the casting, the script, the little bits of humor sprinkled in it. there were so many points where the film could've gone for the cheap thrill, but it never did, and that for me put this movie above so many of the mediocre thrillers that have come out lately...and for the last number of years.	0
i had few problems with this film, and i have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated. true, it is over three hours long, but i was amazed that it goes by so quickly. i don't think it is overrated at all, i think the imdb rating is perfectly decent. the film looks sumptuous, with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects, and the direction from james cameron rarely slips from focus. leonardo dicaprio gives one of his best performances as jack, and kate winslet is lovely as rose. david warner, a great actor, steals every scene he's in. the story is very rich in detail, and is hot on character development, obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be, though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow. the last hour is extremely riveting, and i will confess that i was on the edge of my seat, when the titanic sank. i will also say that the last five minutes were very moving. the music score by james horner was lovely, though i never was a huge fan of the song my heart will go on. the 1996 miniseries was good, but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies. overall, i give titanic an 8.5/10. bethany cox.	0
family problems abound in real life and that is what this movie is about. love can hold the members together through out the ordeals and trials and that is what this movie is about. one man, daddy, has the maturity and fortitude to sustain the family in the face of adversity. the kids grow up,one all be it, in the hard way, to realize that no matter how old they or a parent is, the parent still loves their children and are willing to provide them a cushion when they fall. all the actors portraying their characters did outstanding performances. yes, i shed a tear along the way knowing i had had similar experiences both as a young adult and later as a parent. this true to life is one which every young adult, and parent, would do well to see, although some will not realize it until they too are parents. a must see for those who care about their families.	0
this movie is worth seeing for the visual beauty and moving acting alone, but there also is an interesting cultural subtext of alienation. women and performers (both brought together in a supporting role of a transvestite opera star) are both doomed to be relegated to subserviant roles in china. this makes the unlikely bonding between an aged street performer and a young girl even stronger as a triumph over the native culture.<br /><br />the only problem i had with this movie was the tendency of the soundtrack to swell up with emotion rendered unnecessary by the actors' performance.<br /><br />a welcome alternative to unsatisfying summer action movies.	0
this is a lot of silliness about a woman from london who marries a tea planter from ceylon whom she barely knows. it's full of cliches, and the liz taylor character is not believable. it has a marvelous set, some exotic location footage. it shows taylor at the height of her beauty. she looks stunning.	0
i have to start saying it has been a long time since i have seen it, but have seen it 5 or more times; a wonderful little romp that was clearly inspired by the musical/comedy pairings of new or fading stars with musical groups of prominence. kay kyser's mysteries would be a good example.<br /><br />having spike jones unleashed is the best part of the show, as he and his band play many tunes and are a part of the action, doing a fine job of support. hugh o'brien plays the face, buddy hackett the part rumor has it that was offered to lou costello and thus, abbott and costello replacing the leads. don't know if that was true.<br /><br />all in all, a pleasant movie, but important to have that much spike jones and his band on film for history. wish that it was released, as i haven't seen or heard of it now in two decades. hope it is not lost	0
i love jack's jokes like 'the cliché is...' or ""over the top cliché guy, black, oily skin, kinda spooky..."". he is just hilarious! daniel's starting to catch up on him to! good thing jack's not on the team anymore (in a way) or else it would have been sarcasm mania!!!!i just love all the plots (season 8, a little less, i have to admit), the characters are great, the actors are great, i'm starting to pick up facial expressions (and more) from jack, daniel and teal'c...it just all theoretically possible and exciting...oops! their i go again!!! sorry, i'm also starting to pick up traits from carter, and all of this is driving my parents nutz!!!!!!! well, to conclude, i think it's good for another three seasons or so, especially if they keep on packing the episodes with all this humor, drama, action and so forth!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	0
i'm not entirely sure rob schmidt qualifies as a ""master"" in the genre of horror, since he previously just directed one horror film called ""wrong turn"" and that one was actually just was slightly above mediocre, but fact is that he made with ""right to die"" one of the best and creepiest episodes of the entire second season of the ""masters of horror"" franchise. there was a similar underdog story in season one, when william malone made on of the best episodes with ""the fair haired child"" even though his other long feature films ""fear dot com"" and ""house on haunted hill"" sucked pretty badly.<br /><br />the story of ""right to die"" cleverly picks in on the nowadays piping hot social debate of euthanasia, but thankfully also features multiple old-fashioned horror themes like ghostly vengeance, murderous conspiracies, pitch black humor and comic book styled violence. whilst driving home late one night and discussing the husband's continuous adultery, the addison couple are involved in a terrible car accident. cliff walks away from the wreck unharmed but his wife abby is fully burned and needs to be kept alive artificially. whilst cliff and his sleazy attorney (corbin bernsen of ""the dentist"") want to plug the plug on her and sue the car constructor, abbey's mum sets up a giant media campaign to keep her daughter alive as a vegetable and blame everything on cliff. meanwhile abbey's hateful spirit comes back for revenge and kills someone in cliff's surrounding whenever she has a near fatal experience with the medical devices. after a few victims, cliff realizes it might be safer for him to keep his wife alive if he wants to remain alive as well. ""right to die"" is a stupendous episode and exactly the type of stuff i always hoped to see from a tv-series concept like ""masters of horror"". it's violent and gory with a sick & twisted sense of humor and loads of sleaze sequences. the euthanasia theme and the whole obligatory media circus that surrounds it is processed into the script very well, yet without unnecessarily reverting to political standpoints or morality lessons. the atmosphere is suspenseful and the killing sequences are suitably nasty and unsettling. actresses julia anderson and robin sydney both have pretty face and impressively voluptuous racks, which is always a welcome plus, and corbin bernsen is finally offered the chance again to depict a mean-spirited and egocentric bastard. great ""moh"" episode; definitely one of the highlights of both seasons.	0
i just can't understand the negative comments about this film. yes it is a typical boy-meets-girl romance but it is done with such flair and polish that the time just flies by. henstridge (talk about winning the gene-pool lottery!) is as magnetic and alluring as ever (who says the golden age of cinema is dead?) and vartan holds his own.<br /><br />there is simmering chemistry between the two leads; the film is most alive when they share a scene - lots! it is done so well that you find yourself willing them to get together...<br /><br />ignore the negative comments - if you are feeling a bit blue, watch this flick, you will feel so much better. if you are already happy, then you will be euphoric.<br /><br />(ps: i am 33, male, from the uk and a hopeless romantic still searching for his princess...)	0
rumors is a memorable entry in the wartime series of instructional cartoons starring ""private snafu."" the films were aimed at servicemen and were directed, animated and scored by some of the top talent from warner bros.' termite terrace, including friz freleng, chuck jones, and carl stalling. the invaluable mel blanc supplied the voice for snafu, and the stories and rhyming narration for many of the films was supplied by theodor geisel, i.e. dr. seuss. the idea was to convey basic concepts with humor and vivid imagery, using the character of snafu as a perfect negative example: he was the dope, the little twerp who would do everything you're not supposed to do. according to chuck jones the scripts had to be approved by pentagon officials, but army brass also permitted the animators an unusual amount of freedom concerning language and bawdy jokes, certainly more than theatrical censorship of the time would allow-- all for the greater good, of course.<br /><br />as the title would indicate, this cartoon is an illustration of the damaging power of rumors. the setting is an army camp. private snafu sits next to another soldier in the latrine (something you won't see in any other hollywood films of the era) and their casual conversation starts the ball rolling. we observe as an offhand remark about a bombing is misinterpreted, then exaggerated, then turned into an increasingly frightening rumor that sweeps the camp. the imagery is indeed vivid: the brain of one anxious soldier is depicted as a percolating pot, while the fevered speech of another is rendered as steamy hot air, i.e ""balloon juice."" a soldier ""shoots his mouth off,"" cannon-style, and before you know it actual baloney is flying in every direction. winged baloney, at that. panicked soldiers tell each other that the brooklyn bridge has been pulverized, coney island wiped out, enemy troops have landed on the white house lawn, and the japanese are in california. the visuals become ever more surreal and nightmarish until at last the camp is quarantined for ""rumor-itis"" and private snafu has been locked up in a padded cell.<br /><br />this is a highly effective piece of work. the filmmakers dramatized their theme with wit and startling energy, and the message is still a valid one. in recent years we've seen that catastrophic events (real or imagined) can breed all kinds of wild rumors that spread more rapidly than ever thanks to communication advances. because the technology has improved, the private snafus of our time are able to broadcast their own balloon juice via e-mail, cellphones and blogging. consequently, rumors is a rare example of a wartime educational film whose essential message doesn't feel at all dated; in fact it may be more timely than ever.	0
uneven bollywood drama. karisma kapoor is excellent as an indian woman in canada who marries a friend (sanjay kapoor), has a child, and then visits his family in india only to find they are terrorist warlords. drama and tragedy ensue, and the film becomes a kind of not without my baby styled thriller. film is compelling, its few song/dance numbers are uninteresting and needless, the gaity of bollywood song and dance is really out of character for the intensity of this film's drama, at least once we've left the comforting confines of their canadian love nest  although one number involving a cameo by the stunning aishwarya rai is enjoyably provocative, if ultimately misplaced as well. likewise, the inclusion of bollywood superstar shahrukh khan as a happy-go-lucky drifter who helps kapoor in her escape from the clutches of the warlord turns what had been a very serious drama into a silly farce, and it only gets back on his feet when his character  and his fantasies about rai that generate her cameo dance  are dispensed with. his throw-away comic-book dialog and the silliness of his fight scenes detract from the film's primary gripping drama. the cast is nicely supported by nana patekar as the warlord, and the elegant deepti naval who is outstanding as his long-suffering wife who finally choses to stand up against him in one of the film's best scenes; ritu shivpuri and rajshree solanki are also very good as sanjay's sisters in india, and very pleasing eye candy. but sanjay himself overacts terribly, especially during obvious ad-libs. the directorial style of writer/director krishna wamsi is sloppy, rampant with rough transitions and abrupt cuts, although his camera movement is good. the musical underscore is also quite effective, moody, featuring wordless female voice over a small orchestral ensemble (too bad little if any of that made it onto shakti's soundtrack cd, but bollywood hasn't yet discovered the value of including score along with songs on their soundtrack albums, at least not in most cases). but shakti is karisma kapoor's film, all the way, though, and the intensity of her performance once the film switches to india contrasts nicely with the gentle romance with which she engaged with sanjay in the initial canadian scenes. despite the unevenness of much of the picture, karisma's performance completely sells the film and solidifies its otherwise inconsistent measures. in a strange way, also, i found the story to be another take on the ostentation of royalty i'd noticed in curse of the golden flower and marie antoinette, both of which i'd seen just prior, although shakti of course is an entirely different kind of film; but the focus on a dysfunctional royal family  here living in the austerity of terrorism-controlled poverty in india rather than the elegance of versailles or the massive megalomania of feudal china's tang dynasty  whose self-serving seeking of power brings ruin upon many others and forces an uprising of one kind or another provides the film with a notable subtext.	0
this film has renewed my interest in french cinema. the story is enchanting, the acting is flawless and audrey tautou is absolutely beautiful. i imagine that we will be seeing a lot more of her in the states after her upcoming role in amelie.	0
... and i do mean it. if not literally (after all, i have not seen every movie ever created!), at least, obviously, among the ones, the many i know.<br /><br />5.3 ??? the rule of thumb with imdb is this: sometimes movies rated very highly (for example, the piece of kannes-kompetition-krowned-korean-kraap called ""oldboy"") can be truly bad. but rarely a movie worth watching is actually rated under 6. this movie, very much worth watching, is. a disgrace.<br /><br />true, i give it a 10 in protest. the movie is not perfect. its true rating should be an 8 or a 9. it has some acting flaws (belafonte especially), the script wanders around, sometimes. however, what we have here is one of the greatest directors of all times, the czech jan kadar, directing two of the greatest actors of all time, the beloved, larger-than-life zero mostel and the sublime ida kaminska in an acting/poetic/moral tour de force. a pair made in heaven! it's true that this movie, little flaws apart, does not pander to the average audiences, but those interested in watching an excellent (while, again, not beyond criticism) movie of the incomparable director who gave us ""the shop on the main street"" (the best movie ever about holocaust) should not miss this just because some silly imdb rating system decides that ""american beauty"" is better than ""the angel levine"".<br /><br />it isn't.	0
i do try not to take imdb ratings to heart, but i was flabbergasted when i saw the 5.4 rating to one of my childhood favourites. it doesn't wow me as much at 17, but as a family film this is a sweet and well meaning movie. kids will definitely love it and won't mind the flaws, and the adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messaging of the film. none of the film was preachy in any way, in fact it has a great message that added to its sweetness. i will admit though that the story is on the thin side, and some scenes like screweyes's death(which still freaks me out) may be a tad on the scary side. but the animation is well above average with nice colours and good character animation. the music by james horner is very beautiful, and the song featured is memorable, catchy and amusing. i really liked the characters, louie is probably the most in-depth of them all, but the dinosaurs were at least engaging. martin short's clown was both hilarious and emphatic, the part when he tells screweyes ""i quit!"" had me in stitches. my favourite is screweyes though, an effective villain who is crafty and i suppose intelligent. if anything though, i wish the film kept in the part when he explains how he lost his eye and why he is scared of crows because that way he could've been more developed in terms of depth. the script, while not oscar-worthy, has its funny and heart-warming parts, and should keep kids and adults entertained. the voice acting for me was what made the movie. john goodman, martin short, rhea perlman, felicity kendall and yeardley smith all gave solid performances, but special mention has to go to kenneth mars for he was absolutely superb as screweyes and almost unrecognisable. all in all, this is a good movie. i don't get the rating, honestly i don't. sure this film isn't perfect, and it is not as good as a dinosaur movie such as land before time, but it is good fun. 7.5/10 bethany cox	0
a lot of people unfairly sh!t on this series but several of the guinea pig videos are fairly entertaining. devil's experiment in particular has some really fantastic effects work--not just the infamous eyeball scene but also a very realistic skin slice on the foot and a hand breaking with a sledgehammer are very realistic--especially for the video's vintage and low-budget.<br /><br />let me start at the beginning now for those who don't know: this film is an ""extreme"" torture/fake snuff film that surfaced in japan in the mid-80s. it's plot as it stands is simple: a young girl is held by a few men and forced to undergo a series of brutal tortures to see where her breaking point is. this entails brutal violence--all effectively realistic effects including the ones mentioned in the last paragraph as well as a painful looking application of hot oil to the captive girl's arm and placing of maggots in the subsequent flaky wound.<br /><br />the least effective sequences are at the very beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slap session where three men take turns slapping the hell out of the girl as her head falls about and a second sequence where the three men take turns kicking the girl and pushing her to the ground. these two scenes are obviously staged and detract from the realism of the rest of the proceedings.<br /><br />the actress who plays the victim of the ""experiment"" is pretty convincing at being in pain and takes a good amount of abuse and rough stuff on camera. her reactions as she has headphones strapped to her head and loud noises are played for hours on end are chilling. some of the other abuse she takes is being strung up in a net from a tree during the only times she is given a rest. also there is a disturbing scene where the giggling captors through guts at her and one other disgustingly sleazy scene where she is spun in an office chair and forced to drink a bottle of jack daniels till she pukes.<br /><br />if you haven't seen this series i hope i have helped you decide whether or not you want to give this episode a shot. 8.5/10 for devil's experiment.	0
opening the film with a bach toccata is an aural hint of what is to unfold in this intense drama. all the compositional devices bach perfected to keep his listener (and the performer) intrigued and entertained applies to this film. there isn't a mutual tenderness between the two lead characters and the lead female in the final scene i feel is justified in stating she was raped even though her victimizer feels she was forewarned that he was a cad. mamet compellingly explores the emotional chasm and differences between the genders but i feel he is clueless about how they actually compliment one another given a healthy sense of humor. if mamet ever developed a healthy humorous take on the interaction between the genders i wonder how this work would have ended? as it exists it is very somber and mean spirited.	0
`bruce almighty' will sweep the academy awards with a record 14 oscar wins! it will surpass `titanic' as the highest grossing film of all time! jim carrey's illustriousness will be at such a supreme level that he will announce his presidential candidacy for the 2004 white house playoffs. almighty then! these grandeur fantasies would only transpire if the filmmakers (carrey included) would possess the powers of god. that very same premise is the paramount ingredient in carrey's new laugh riot `bruce almighty'. carrey plays bruce nolan, a televison reporter who is so utterly obsessed in being the main anchor that he holds god to total culpability for his own contretemps. god, heavenly played by morgan freeman, grants bruce the `gift of god'(his powers) in order to challenge him if he can do god's job any better. obviously, bruce gets `carreyed' away with his newfound blissful faculties and uses them selfishly. carrey is back in his habitual almighty comedic form in `bruce almighty'. jennifer aniston was not `mis.pittiful' as bruce's girlfriend. however, my premier kudos goes to director tom shadyac for not letting the dog out of the house for #2, and showing us the most hilarious doggoned bathroom scene of all time! `bruce almighty' is not the most in-depth carrey film, but it is still an almighty chuckling exhibition of `carreyism'! **** good	0
i've spent years looking for a copy of this film(16mm,dvd,vhs), so i could show it to my kids. the movie is funny, and spike and the members of his band show why they were the best musicians in the business. they had to be that good to play that demented. i like it and recommend it for movie lovers of all ages.<br /><br />the movie is about a turn of the century firehouse, with a crew of misfits that are firemen and the department band (when not fighting the fires). there's the usual running gags, plus the mayhem of spike jones and his orchestra. also, comedy relief provided by comedian buddy hackett and straight-man hugh o'brien.	0
the performance by om puri, smita patil, and sadashiv amrapurkar and the whole chemistry comes off nicely, along with the minimalist approach to story telling and direction by govind nihlani. the dialogues by vijay tendulkar is also great. <br /><br />i have not seen another movie like this. it is one whole, each piece so nicely fit in the plot. you cannot not be impressed by this movie. <br /><br />amrish puri comes off as the bossy husband and 'baap' of om puri. om puri is the young man caught between his sense of duty and his inability to fight the system. sadhashiv as rama shetty gives just about the right touch to the movie with his smiling and soft speaking villain. the first meeting of anand velankar with rama shetty's at sadhashiv's place is absoulely stunning. smita patil does not play a main role, but her part is also not distracting from the main plot. <br /><br />and to add to this all kafi inamdar plays the role of a cop who has come to terms with the system and its workings. saying right things in the right places and knowing how to keep himself away from trouble. he is also the 'guru' of om puri and helps him whenever he gets into trouble.<br /><br />the movie not only brings to focus the difficulties faced by a police officer trying to do his duty but also the other side of brutalities in police custody. om puri captures hopelessness and the burning desire to break free in this exceptional performance in ardh satya. <br /><br />a treat to all avid fans of indian cinema.	0
directed by govind nihalani, this is definite cop film of indian cinema. may be the first one which portrayed the stark reality of corruption in the police force & politics with no holds barred & how it effects on a young cop. a man forced to join a career of a cop by his cop father. agreed that we grew up watching lot of good cop/bad cop hindi films but this is different. today's generation, which grown up watching dark & realistic films like- 'satya', 'company' may be consider it inferior product in comparison but look at the time of its making. the film was made absolutely off beat tone in the time when people didn't pay much attention to such kind of cinema & yet it becomes a most sought after cop film in class & mass audience when it released. for om puri its first breakthrough in mainstream hindi cinema & he delivered a class performance as inspector velankar. its more than cop character, he internalized a lot which is something original in acting. watch his scenes with his father whom he hates & smita whom he loves. smita patil maintained the dignity of her character to the expected level. my god what a natural expressions she carried!!! shafi inamdar was truly a discovery for me & he's a brilliant character actor if given a chance & here in some of the scenes he outsmarted even om. the movie is also a debut of a promising villain on indian screen- sadashiv amrapurkar as 'rama shetty'. it's another story that he didn't get such a meaty role & almost forgotten today as one of the loud villain of dharmendra's b grade action films. watch the scene where om 1st time becomes a rebel for his father (played by amrish puri) & next both are sharing wine together. how inner truth started revealing for both the character with confronting feelings of love & hate for each other. two faces of indian police force- masculinity & impotency and in between lies- half truth (ardh satya)kudos to nihalani's touch. the film won 2 national awards as best hindi feature film & best actor- om puri & 3 filmfare awards in best film, best director & best supporting actor categories. <br /><br />recommended to all who are interested in nostalgia of serious hindi films.<br /><br />ratings- 8/10	0
after 'aakrosh' , this was the second film for govind nihalani as a director.till this movie was made there was no audience for documentaries in india.this movie proved a point that a documentary can fulfil the requirements of a commercial film without diluting its essence. it was one of the successful movies in the year in which it was released. this movie contested against the big banners of the bollywood like'coolie', 'betaab','hero' in 1983.<br /><br />smithapatel, in this movie acted more like a conscience of the hero whenever he drifted away or lost his composure she was there to remind him. she was not like an usual heroine to do the usual stuff of running around the trees and shrubs.at one time,she even gave up her love when the hero's ruthlessness touched the roof top.<br /><br />there was another character in this movie, which was played by om puri contemporary, naseeruddin shah.he played as an inspector-turned-alcoholic character.the role conveyed the message of the end result of a honest cop who rubbed the wrong side of the system which also gave the viewers a chance to forecast the hero's ending.<br /><br />in his debut film,sadashiv amrapurkar captivated the audience with his cameo role which ultimately won him the best supporting actor by the filmfare.the cop in the movie was not a complete straight forward personality he was able to adjust to the system to an extent. the anger which left half handedly continued in govind nihalani's other film ""drohkaal"". even after two decades, this movie is remembered just because of the director and the entire crew. each one played their part par excellence.	0
""ardh satya"" is one of the finest film ever made in indian cinema. directed by the great director govind nihalani, this one is the most successful hard hitting parallel cinema which also turned out to be a commercial success. even today, ardh satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of india.<br /><br />the film tells the real-life scenario of mumbai police of the 70s. unlike any police of other cities in india, mumbai police encompasses a different system altogether. govind nihalani creates a very practical outlay with real life approach of mumbai police environment.<br /><br />amongst various police officers & colleagues, the film describes the story of anand velankar, a young hot-blooded cop coming from a poor family. his father is a harsh police constable. anand himself suffers from his father's ideologies & incidences of his father's atrocities on his mother. anand's approach towards immediate action against crime, is an inert craving for his own job satisfaction. the film is here revolved in a plot wherein anand's constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors.this leads to frustrations, as he cannot achieve the desired job-satisfaction. resulting from the frustrations, his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms & bars, also turning him to an alcoholic.<br /><br />the spirit within him is still alive, as he constantly fights the system. he is aware of the system of the metro, where the police & politicians are a inertly associated by far end. his compromise towards unethical practice is negative. finally he gets suspended.<br /><br />the direction is a master piece & thoroughly hard core. one of the best memorable scenes is when anand breaks in the underworld gangster rama shetty's house to arrest him, followed by short conversation which is fantastic. at many scenes, the film has hair-raising moments.<br /><br />the practical approach of script is a major punch. alcoholism, corruption, political influence, courage, deceptions all are integral part of mumbai police even today. those aspects are dealt brilliantly.<br /><br />finally, the films belongs to the one man show, om puri portraying anand velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly.	0
an absolute classic !! the direction is flawless , the acting is just superb. words fall short for this great work. the most definitive movie on mumbai police. this movie has stood the test of times.<br /><br />om puri gives a stellar performance, smita patil no less. all the actors have done their best and the movie races on thrilling you at every moment. this movie shakes your whole being badly and forces you to rethink about many issues that confront our society.<br /><br />this is the story of a cop (om puri ) who starts out in his career as a honest man but ultimately degenerates into a killer. the first attempt in bollywood to get behind the scenes and expose the depressing truth about mumbai cops. kudos to nihalani !! <br /><br />after this movie a slew of bollywood movies got released that exposed the criminal-politician-police nexus. thus this movie was truly a trend setter. this trend dominated the hindi movie scene for more than a decade. <br /><br />this movie was a moderate box office hit. <br /><br />a must-see for discerning movie fans.	0
govind nihalani's directorial venture of vijay tendulkar's novel is brilliant. om puri plays an inspector velankar who is forced to protect underworld don rama shetty, played brilliantly by sadahiv amrapurkar. this is govind nihlan's most talked about movie. this is a very good and a classic film. smita patil plays the female lead opposite om puri. naseeruddin shah is brilliant in a cameo role. although sadashiv amrapurkar has only 4 scenes in the movie he dominates the movie. this was sadashiv amrapurkars acting debut.om puri won a national award for this film for the best actor. filmfare award winner for best film,story,supporting actor(sadashiv amrapurkar).	0
i love this show!<br /><br />every time i watch an episode i repeat that line and remind myself how good of a show this is. i am a huge sci-fi fan and this show has grounds to be the most important science (fiction?) show in the history of film/tv. there are so many theories in this show about the universe i could start a religion. its amazing, season after season the show gets better and better.<br /"	0
this is one of those movies that they did too much promoting for. if you watch t.v., then you might as well not watch the movie. almost all the funny scenes are spoiled in the previews, except one which just happens to be jennifer annisten being the funny one. it is typical jim carrey humor and it is really funny. just don't go see this movie expecting to be surprised. all in all, if you like jim carrey or comedies this is a must-see, otherwise just watch the previews and you'll be just as satisfied.	0
i absolutely loved this movie. it met all expectations and went beyond that. i loved the humor and the way the movie wasn't just randomly silly. it also had a message. jim carrey makes me happy. :)	0
wow, finally jim carrey has returned from the died. this movie had me laughing and crying. it also sends a message that we should all know and learn from. jeniffer aniston was great, she will finally have a hit movie under her belt. if you liked liar liar you will love this movie. i give it 9/10.	0
i have to say, from the beginning, when i watched the stargate movie movie i wasn't blown away or anything it was like an average sci fi movie, with a lot of potential, though the movie wasn't as, erm, amazing as other sci fi movies such as star wars or aliens, which if u are a sci fi fanatic u will admit one of those two titles are amazing, even though i'm not as hardcore sci fi fan as some people, i don't remember one line from either of those movies, i'm not a big fan of wearing star wars t shirts, in fact if you saw me i would look like an average person to you, ah getting slightly off the point here, well my point is that the that you don't have to be a hard core sci fi fan to like this great series, which unfortunately ended after 10 amazing seasons with no drop in its quality as it got nearer to its end, in 2006.<br /><br />though i didn't like the movie much i was quite looking forward to the first season in 1997, and let me tell you, the special effects were only one of the brilliant things about the series, the chemistry between the characters just blew me away the special affects, were as good if not better than most sci fi shows running today. i have to admit that i would never have gone into sci fi if it wasn't for stargate, and my dad, who actually got me into sci fi when i was like 6, and i'm glad he did, other wise i wouldn't have seen the brilliant shows like sg1, which now in my opinion sets the benchmark for nearly all sci fi series and movies, basically if a new sci fi series isn't better or as good as sg1, its not worth watching. basically this is the best sci fi show to date, and if you don't watch this, then you have no idea what you are missing!	0
"bruce almighty is the best jim carrey work since the truman show, and was a pleasant surprise after some of his recent ""hey hollywood - look how good i can act!"" box office disappointments. it's great to see jim recognizing and embracing his strengths. he won't get an academy award but the film itself will last longer than many of the ""awarded films"" of the academy. he is at the top of his form in this most recent film - it's like the return of an old friend.<br /><br />carrey, freeman, and aniston all do a great job together - comfortable in their comedy roles, superb comic timing, and obviously having fun together but without the ""hey mom - look how funny i am"" type of comedy. a real surprise was steven carrell as carrey's nemesis (carrell of the daily show fame), who walked away with some the best and funniest scenes of the film. i laughed harder at carell than anyone else in the past three years.<br /><br />i can foresee the religious nuts in the us will be up-in-arms over the treatment of god, but the bottom line of the film is true to all major theological beliefs - we are masses of protoplasms trying to get through our short lives by exercising our free will. without married with children t o complain about, this will likely become a target of people with misplaced priorities (who know the types - men adorned in gold watches on sunday morning and late nigh television, selling prayers to god). and, again, about 0.5% of the country will care and 80% of the media will report it.<br /><br />the bottom line: this a purely entertaining film, each audience member laughingly wondering what they would do, and a feel-good feeling at the movie conclusion. a walk down any major street in america has to confirm that god has a tremendous sense of humor. what better comic genius to remind us of that than jim carry.<br /><br />thanks again, jim -- it's great to have you back!!"	0
"after a slow beginning, bruce almighty is a very funny film that had something positive to say. it wasn't one of jim carrey's best performances, but he was still ok. morgan freeman was just right as god. jennifer aniston had some good moments. i miss steve correll on ""the daily show!""<br /><br />i like director tom shadyac's choices of movies. he also did liar liar, patch adams, and the nutty professor. in all three of those and in bruce almighty, he takes a big comedy star and tells a human story with him. a director who knows comedy, can get the talent he gets, and can tell a meaningful and intelligent story with it is hard to find.<br /><br />my biggest complaint is that they should have used more biblical references. i only remember three specific biblical references and they were the three funniest parts of the whole movie. my guess is that the first few drafts of the screenplay had more biblical references, but they were cut out because the producers were afraid of offending people. that's too bad because i thought it was a missed opportunity.<br /><br />my grade:<br /><br />7 out of 10"	0
let me start out by saying i'm a big carrey fan. although i'll admit i haven't seen all of his movies *cough*the magestic*cough*. bruce almighty was enjoyable. none of the other reviews have really gone into how cheesy it gets towards the end, i dont know what the writers were thinking. somehow i couldn't help but feel like this movie was a poor attempt at re-creating liar liar.<br /><br />on a positive note, the daily show's steve correl is hilarious and so is the rest of the cast. see bruce almighty if you're a big jim carrey fan, or if you just want to see a light-hearted (que soft piano music) somewhat funny comedy.	0
jim carrey and morgan freeman along with jennifer aniston combine to make one of the funniest movies so far this 2003 season (late may) and a good improvement on carrey's past crazy and personally forgetable roles in past comedies. with a slightly toned down carrey antics yet with just the zap and crackle of his old self, carrey powerfully carries this movie to the height of laughter and also some dramatic, tearfully somber moments. elements of jim's real acting abilities continue to show up in this movie. this delightful summer entertainment hits most of the buttons, including dramatic elements along with the goofy moments that fit perfectly with this script. while still lacking in the superbly polished ensemble of comedy/drama, bruce, almightly deserves credit for being a great date movie along with a solid message and soft spiritual cynicism and parody that maintains its good-natured taste. eight out of ten stars.	0
ok, so it's not a masterpiece like the godfather, but it doesn't have to be. the only purpose this movie has is to make the viewer laugh several times. if it can make the viewer laugh a bunch of times, it has accomplished its purpose. i laughed out loud and left with a smile. i feel like i got my money's worth.	0
"fairly funny jim carrey vehicle that has him as a news reporter who temporarily gets the power of god and wrecks havoc. carrey is back in familiar ground here and looks to be having a good time, and jennifer aniston as his put upon girlfriend is also charming and affecting. the story is predictible to the extreme but the cast (including morgan freeman as ""god"") is great and makes the film worth catching. grade: b"	0
"well not actually. this movie is very entertaining though. went and saw it with the girlfriend last night and had to use the ""i think there might be something in my eye"" routine. the movie is a great combination of comedy and typical romance. jim carey is superb as a down on his luck reporter who is given the power to change himself and the city in which he resides. in fact all the characters are great. the movie is not overly funny or sappy, good flick to go see with the wife.<br /><br />all in all 8/10....note * i am not an easy grader. thats all from bigv over and out!"	0
i for one was glad to see jim carrey in a film where being over the top wasn't the goal. his character is like all of us. wanting more - better things to happen to us and expecting god to deliver.<br /><br />morgan freeman made a great god. with a sense of humor and a genuine sense of love for each of us yet ready to take a little vacation when the opportunity presents itself.<br /><br />i thought jennifer aniston's character was a little too vulnerable and understanding towards carry's basically self-centered tv anchorman wanna-be but that's the way it was written.<br /><br />i think the previews ruined several potentially very funny scenes because everyone who saw them knew what was coming before it happened.<br /><br />i have read a number of the reviews and it seems some people are looking a little too deep. this is a summer comedy and is not meant to solve the problems of the world although there are a few messages we could all take to heart.<br /><br />a funny film.	0
i am a very big jim carrey fan. i laughed my ass off during liar liar and ace ventura. i also like him in his serious movies, especially truman show. this one is a cross between his very funny side, and his serious side. he is of course very funny in this movie, but there are parts that are very serious, and he pulls it off with a lot of ease. he is truely a multi-function actor.<br /><br />as for the rest of the cast, i was happy with jennifer aniston's acting. i think she is more than just a couple of nice tits and great ass. morgan freeman makes a very cool god. as for steven carell, his limited scenes are very funny, especially in the anchor scene.<br /><br />overall, i would have to rate this a 9. good acting, funny script, and some very serious situations make this a very good film.	0
"i would have rated the series a perfect 10 for outstanding and consistently high quality story and character development had it not been for the last episode of season 10! <br /><br />the final episode of the 10th season ""unending"", where (it would certainly appear that) the asgard have been killed-off in a very rushed, unconvincing and very unceremonious fashion, left me in disbelief! <br /><br />from the extremely rushed end of the series, it's obvious that many of the story arcs were originally scheduled to occur over at least one more season. my guess would be that they rapidly accelerated these stories to position the stargate sg-1 franchise for the two upcoming direct-to-dvd moves!<br /><br />unless the asgard return in a future sg-1 movie (with a very good explanation of the ""apparent"" extinction), i think that the fans have been cheated with a poor clean-up of loose-ends!<br /><br />poor end to an otherwise brilliant sci-fi series."	0
"i first heard about this film about 20 years ago when i was a kid in grade school(!), it just so happened that i was thumbing through the encyclopedias in the classroom one day, and under the entry for movies (or cinema, i don't remember), were several stills for different movies from mainstream to experimental, and one of them shown on the page was a still for offon. it really intrigued me, since it stood out the most on the page (it was a still from the film of the scene with the eye with other elements superimposed over it).<br /><br />about 18 or so years later, the public library here where i live had available for checkout the whole 4-dvd set of ""treasures of american film archives"" released by the national film preservation foundation. so when i was reading the notes on the dvd cases for the set, i was quite pleasantly surprised to see that offon was on one of the discs. after all these years, i could finally see the film! after viewing it, it slightly wasn't was i was expecting it to be (it tended to be a more organic-looking film, not that that's a bad thing, but i was expecting it to have a more electronic aesthetic), but it was still an impressive film, imho, considering the techniques scott bartlett used to make the film, including hand-tinting the film itself, and using video equipment for some of the film's scenes (filmed off of a video monitor), giving it a more distressed, lo-res look.<br /><br />don't get me wrong, the techniques used in this film were quite ground-breaking for 1972. that's why it's still one of my favorite short/experimental films, and a creative inspiration for me as well..."	0
a very funny movie. it was good to see jim carrey back in top form. it was definitely worth the price of admission. morgan freeman and jennifer aniston both played outstanding supporting roles in this film. i think they may have played the dog a bit too much however, still a good film to see.	0
bruce almighty, one of carrey's best pictures since... well... a long time. it contains one of the funniest scenes i have seen for a long time too... morgan freeman plays god well and even chips in a few jokes that are surprisingly funny. it contains one or two romantic moments that are a bit boring but over all a great movie with some funny scenes. the best scene in, it is where jim is messing up the anchor man's voice.<br /><br />my rating: 8/10	0
"this film is the best film jim carrey has ever made. carrey did not have his usual face making stuff in this film. he was both funny and sad. carrey played a reporter named bruce nolan. nolan blames god(morgan freeman) for everything that goes wrong in his life. then, god comes down from heaven and gives bruce his powers. as i said before, carrey did an excellent job. i also thought that morgan freeman and jennifer aniston were great as supporting actor/actress. the plot was good because it had many subpoints in the main point. this movie can be funny(bruce's dog) as well as sad(the ""break-up""). the script worked well, too. i am glad they made a sequel to this film. i rate this film a 9/10."	0
bruce almighty is the story of bruce nolan, an average man who feels god is messing up his life. god confronts him and show bruce the error of his ways. of course, giving someone god's powers could take a turn for the worse. bruce almighty is a good comedy, jim carrey is good, as always morgan freeman is first-rate and seems right at home as god and the cast brings the plot together well. the jokes are almost always on target, although sometimes they resort a bit too much on carrey's facial expressions. i liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed god, not only that but also as a black man. i thought this quite well, especially with the brilliant freeman. there are some hilarious scenes, the opening cookie scene for instance, others miss the target slightly but still a good film. 6/7 out of 10	0
"bruce almighty"" looks and sounds incredibly stupid, especially from the trailers. nevertheless, i found in it a deeper message that actually made me like this film more. bruce (jim carrey) is angry at god and is given divine powers by him to be god for a week to see if he can do a better job. morgan freeman plays a man symbolized here as god, and though it isn't his usual type of film or one of his best roles, he does excellent with what he is given to work with. although crude at times, the film does have quite a few laughs, from bruce parting his soup in half like the red sea and the customers' reactions to him, as well as freeman's seemingly laid-back and wisecracking image of god. it is overly exaggerated at times, and there is some crude humor, but overall it manages to be somewhat funny. there is a decent supporting cast, such as jennifer aniston, lisa ann walter, and steve carrell, which always helps. the end of the film proves to be very romantic and tear-jerking, and the message is clear, that we should do what god has called us to do and ""be the miracle."" the film is far from perfect, but still enjoyable, and far better than i and many people probably would have expected, especially if we see the deeper message of the film.<br /><br />*** out of ****	0
if you want a serious laugh pain, watch this movie, and the things bruce inflicts on his fellow newscaster. the deleted scenes are priceless. i don't know why they didn't include them in the original movie. it can't be because of time, since the movie is only 101 minutes long. morgan freeman is a brilliant actor, who has been overlooked for too long. jim carrey needs meds!	0
as someone who lives near buffalo, new york, this movie scored points with me before i even saw it, since the story is based here. there are even some bit parts with real-life news-tv anchor people from buffalo..and, for once, it doesn't knock the area. hallelujah!<br /><br />theology-wise, puh-leeze!!! god is still made to look and think like humans...and, of course, be a bit on the liberal side. being the lightweight comedy it is, it's nothing that should win any awards but it still is entertaining and is a pleasant way to kill 102 minutes. <br /><br />there are some laugh-out-loud slapstick comedy scenes and, hopefully, audiences - from christians to atheists.- got something out of this besides a few laughs, such as what prayer should really be all about. kudos to the writers for at least getting that theology correct and giving a good message.<br /><br />overall, it's a good-hearted film that should offend very few.	0
i really do not know what people have against this film, but it's definitely one of my favourites. it's not preachy, it's not anchored by it's moral, it shouldn't be controversial. it's just god. any possible god, no matter the religion. and it's really funny.<br /><br />jim carry plays bruce nolan, a tv reporter usually stuck on the lighter side of the news, desperate to prove himself (more or less to himself) that he can be taken seriously and do a good job in an anchor job. this drive is what is slowly driving his beautiful girlfriend grace (jennifer aniston) away. when the final straws are executed, he's quick to not laugh, but yell in the face of god, who in turn gives bruce his powers. bruce then makes his life better for himself, until he's guilted into helping others, where he then continues to miss the point of his powers. meanwhile, his constant excitement about his own life makes him more selfish, leaving his relationship on dangerous ground.<br /><br />ok, that was kinda long. but as a plot, it works well. the step-by-step fashion in which we meet the challenges of being god is much better than clustering his problems together, and is able to hide itself fairly well.<br /><br />as you probably know from hearing about this movie in the first place, carrey's pitch-perfect acting stays in character (which, luckily enough, is him), and controls and gives atmosphere to the movie scene by scene. whether they would admit it or not, the role was written or rewritten exclusively for carrey. without him, the humour would turn flat, as humour is half execution. and the humour is very good in the first place. but without carrey, it would kinda feel like a it's a wonderful life wannabe.<br /><br />jennifer aniston is great and, no matter what some may say, does not act like the only excuse for the third act. at least, you don't think that when you see her. she gives a heartfelt performance and makes you forget you're watching a movie, she and carrey feel very much like a real couple.<br /><br />the movie feels ggooooodd (see the movie to understand), has a very nice feeling, tackles the idea appropriately and better than expected and overall should never have been called slapped together just to save carrey's career (which wasn't goin' anywhere.).	0
well, was morgan freeman any more unusual as god than george burns? this film sure was better than that bore, ""oh, god"". i was totally engrossed and lmao all the way through. carrey was perfect as the out of sorts anchorman wannabe, and aniston carried off her part as the frustrated girlfriend in her usual well played performance. i, for one, don't consider her to be either ugly or untalented. i think my favorite scene was when carrey opened up the file cabinet thinking it could never hold his life history. see if you can spot the file in the cabinet that holds the events of his bathroom humor: i was rolling over this one. well written and even better played out, this comedy will go down as one of this funnyman's best.	0
now either you like mr carrey's humour or you don't. me, myself and irene had audiences both walking out in droves and, on the other hand, cheering and collapsing in puddles of mirth. bruce almighty is a bit more mainstream, but you have been warned.<br /><br />if you're not sure, watch the trailer. i saw the trailer three times and still laughed at the same gags when i saw the film. if you don't find the sight of a dog putting the seat down after using the loo funny, don't bother with the movie.<br /><br />carrey, a reporter stuck in a rut covering 'lighter news' berates god when the whole of his life seems to be going to pot. god takes up the challenge and asks carrey if he can do better. carrey gets into the swing of having all of god's powers by making his girlfriend (jennifer aniston)'s breasts bigger, getting himself promoted, and answering everyone's prayers by single stroke computer commands.<br /><br />this is not a highbrow movie or even that memorable, but it is very well made within it's very limited intent, provides almost continuous laughs to carrey fans, and even any religious cheesiness is likely to be inoffensive to all but the most narrow-minded god-squadders and anti-god-squadders.<br /><br />on the more thoughtful level, the film tempts us to speculate about carrey's own career - stuck in his 'comedy' typecasting he has largely failed to make an impression as a serious actor even after winning two golden globes. his most accomplished 'straight' role, the man on the moon, is less well known that his comedy romps - or the truman show (on which the academy heaped three nominations whilst bypassing carrey).	0
i nominate this and babylon 5 as the best television sci-fi series made. both stand out in my mind because unlike early star trek series, there is a consistent evolution of plots and characters. if you look at the original star trek and star trek:tng, they were fine shows, but there was no overall theme or plot that connected all the episodes. in many ways, you could usually watch the shows totally out of sequence with no difficulty understanding what is occurring. this was less the case with deep space 9 (with its giant battles that took up all of the final season) and the other trek shows, as there was more of a larger story that unified them. this coherence seems to have developed as a concept with babylon 5 and saw this to an even greater extent with sg-1. the bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long novel slowly take form. sure, there were a few ""throwaway"" episodes that were not connected to the rest, but these were very few and far between and were also usually pretty funny.<br /><br />and speaking of funny, i loved that sg-1 kept the mood light from time to time and wasn't so dreadfully serious. in this way, i actually enjoyed it more than babylon 5. jack o'neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love of homer simpson--it's really too bad he slowly faded from the series in later seasons.<br /><br />to truly appreciate sg-1, you should watch it from the beginning and see how intricately the plots work. this coherence gives the show exceptional staying power. and, if you don't like sg-1 after giving it a fair chance, then sci-fi is probably not the genre for you.	0
jim carrey is back to much the same role that he played in the mask, a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck. even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums (and of course they have to be mexican, obviously), his good will towards his fellow man backfires. in that case, it wasn't too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums, but i like that the movie suggests that things like that shouldn't be ignored. i'm reminded of the episode of michael moore's brilliant the awful truth, when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay. the results were not very promising, so it's nice to see someone in the movies setting a good example.<br /><br />jim carrey plays the part of bruce nolan, the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems to be falling apart. or even better, it seems to be breaking up by the blows of bad luck like an asteroid entering the atmosphere (a little metaphor that comes up when bruce miraculously finds himself a gigantic news story later in the film). bruce is nearly 40 years old and all he has to show for it is a position as a news reporter of the sort that reports on such exciting news as the local bakery that's seeking to bake the world's biggest cookie. he's desperate to obtain the job of head anchor at the tv station, but he loses his cool on live tv when he hears that the job went to his rival colleague. you have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report. needless to say, he loses his temper on live tv in one of the funniest scenes of the entire film.<br /><br />morgan freeman delivers a fantastic performance as the man himself, displaying a god whose infinite wisdom is somewhat reflected through freeman's massive talent as an actor. he is the kind of god who takes his job very seriously, but in such a way as to advise his followers (as well as the viewers of this movie) that there are times when you need to slow down and do some manual labor in life. i love his line that some of the happiest people in the world come home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day. there are a lot of people in the world (maybe more than our share in america) who are so absorbed by their money and their possessions and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humans.<br /><br />one of the biggest strengths is that the movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about improving their lives, and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewer's religion. i, for example, tend to reject organized religion in all forms and i see god and satan to be metaphors for different aspects of nature and human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived or continue to live. but despite the fact that i don't believe that god exists as an entity overseeing the universe or as a janitor dressed all in white who mops the floors of his downtown office in his spare time, i was able to appreciate the messages that were delivered in this movie.<br /><br />jim carrey's movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together and makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he's come. if you compare bruce almighty with movies like ace ventura (both of which i loved, by the way) or a lot of what he did before he got into film, it's amazing how far he's come. he has moved from cheesy tv comedy to cheesy comedic films to comedies that are truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as others like the truman show, man on the moon, and the majestic (easily one of his greatest films ever). jim carrey has unmistakably moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working today.<br /><br />jennifer aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie (as she did in the side-splitting office space) as bruce's girlfriend, who becomes increasingly exasperated by bruce's growing stress about his life as well as his negligence to ask her to marry him. there is definitely some low-brow comedy in the film that doesn't really fit with the importance of the film's meaning or the quality of the delivery, such as the dog reading the newspaper on the toilet and the whole monkey scene, but it was definitely pretty nice to see ace ventura's friend spike make a cameo appearance. as stephen king very well knows, it's always nice to see familiar characters. it's almost like seeing family again.<br /><br />bruce is endowed with the powers of god for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better, and he says a lot about himself when he uses the powers only for his own purposes rather than to help all of the people who pray to him. the thing i love about this is that, like i said before, religion is absent from my life, but i was able to watch this and learn a lot about myself as well by thinking about what kinds of things i would have done had i been endowed with such powers. the movie allows us to learn vicariously this way, which empowers the message even more.<br /><br />the scenes that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film, such as the scene when bruce loses his temper about the anchor position, the jimmy hoffa scene (who was conveniently buried with an original birth certificate and a complete set of dental records), the scene where bruce's rival colleague is made to go nuts on camera, and my favorites, the ones at the beginning and the end involving the local bakery's cooking. the movie has plenty of time for carrey to deliver some excellent jokes, such as when he says to god (who reveals that he's the janitor, the proprietor, the electrician, etc) that his christmas parties must be real bashes, and to be careful about drinking, because on of him might need a ride home! i also loved the end when he says that behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes. a little too true, and as gallagher would add, behind every great man is also an amazed mother-in-law.<br /><br />bruce almighty is one of the more memorable comedies to have come out for quite a while, and is probably the only directly religious that i can remember seeing that i am anxious to buy on dvd to add to my personal collection. it is a comedy written and performed in good taste, but with enough relatively low-brow humor to keep the kids entertained. this is a meaningful comedy for the whole family, which is becoming rarer and rarer these days. in a world that is about to be flogged with yet another american pie film and another scary movie (which are only scary because of their sheer barbarous idiocy), it's nice to see that there are still people making comedies worth watching. don't miss this one.	0
as long as you go into this movie knowing that it's terrible: bad acting, bad ""effects,"" bad story, bad... everything, then you'll love it. this is one of my favorite ""goof on"" movies; watch it as a comedy and have a dozen good laughs!	0
china o'brien (1990) was an attempt to make cynthia rothrock a star in the united states. this golden harvet production was helmed by veteran director robert clouse. sadly he was either lucky with enter the dragon or he's lost his touch because he's not that great of a director. the only reason to watch this movie is to see the fighting skills of ms. rothrock and richard norton. if this movie was directed by corey yuen or hoi meng it could have been an action classic instead of a cheesy straight-to-video action flick.<br /><br />china o'brien returns home to help out her dad. he's having trouble with the local mob and he needs her help. so she returns home and restores order (with the help of two unlikely people). but will they be enough to topple mister big and his evil cronies?<br /><br />if you're a big cynthia rothrock fan then this movie's catered for you. i only enjoyed the fighting scenes, everything else is rubbish. why didn't raymond chow shell out a few shekels and hired a top notch action director?<br /><br />recommended.	0
this one and ""her pilgrim soul"" are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of twilight zone. as i mentioned in my comment on the new series, there's something lacking in this new series. maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that has to be learned. it's a little bit more mawkish and sentimental than serling's version. however, this episode can be considered as quite sentimental too. i think the appeal is that no matter what they do, the lovers can never unite. i remember i wasn't surprised by the korean movie ""il mare"" (later remade into ""the lake house"". i think it's because i saw this episode first so it ruined the impact of the later film.	0
this a good episode of the new twilight zone that actually includes interesting ideas and clever stories (i note both of them are based on short stories). ""examination day"" is set in the future, year unknown but at a point where they have cake candles that light themselves, huge tv-looking ""phones"" that double as numerous other entertaining machines and distributed only to those of a certain age...and the examination day, a point where 12-year-olds must undergo a government-required iq test. the kid is this story, dickie jordan (david mendenhall) is just celebrating his own 12th birthday and is a smart kid, so is calm, even eager to take the test that he has seen friends pass easily and knows he will excel at based on his school grades. his parents (christopher allport and elizabeth norment), on the other hand, say he shouldn't have used his birthday wish on getting a good score, and while their reason includes that they believe he's capable and he should have no need to worry, it's pretty obvious they are worried. i won't give anything away in the ending, but i will say this - there's a point where we get a glimpse of what's to come as far ass why the test is such a heavy subject: that evening (or another?) his parents ask dickie whether he'd prefer to watch tv all night. by today's standards, we'd be pleased he'd say he'd rather read and not just because there's nothing worth watching...but why would his family ask this? the flavor of what's encouraged and discouraged in the future reminded me a bit of the atmosphere from harrison bergenon (which i hear hasn't received a great adaptation to the screen). i only wish they could've provided an opening and closing narration to make this theme as powerful as the obsolete man was. i found it to be better than the short story it was based on. i haven't read the one that ""a message from charity"" was based on, but would like to since it was interesting - a 16-year-ld boy, peter (robert duncan mcneill) is suffering a fever from unclean water, that has always been common in his massachusetts hometown...but he is able to see through the eyes of a young puritan woman suffering the same type of fever, charity payne, (kerry noonann) who also finds herself able to experience what goes on around him. they both recover, especially since it's common for that to happen in 1985, but the connection doesn't go away. charity is curious about the sights and sounds she records of 1985 and they each enjoy each other's company, especially peter, who has promoted grades in school enough to always have felt isolated from other students, even at the college he's been staying in one place at. things take an unexpected turn, though, when charity reveals some of these experiences to a friend who take her claims that the 13 colonies will breach from england as a sign of bewitchment, added to the fact that she was spared death from the fever (not so common in 1700). the two try to learn a way to save her. the ending is sad but has an interesting final moment that makes it touching. both segments of this episode include a lot of pain but both times, through a lesson/warning that sounds like something rod sterling would've cooked up and entertainment, make cheerful watching as reminders that friendship, love, and wisdom do a great deal. probably 3/4 of this has no theme, but somehow i think it all would have been approved by sterling's crew.	0
remember these two stories fondly and in the first, set in the not too distant future, we see a young boy preparing for examination day, the state i.q test. the boy is slightly puzzled as to his parents anxiety as some of his friends have already done it already and eventually goes off to do the test. upon arriving he is given an injection and is curious as to why. the examiner smiles and tells him that it is just to make sure he tells the truth. the boy then asks, puzzled again, why wouldn't he? it is later and the parents are sitting waiting worriedly by the screen when a message appears and declares that the state are sorry, but their son's i.q level has exceeded the national quotient and ask politely would they like a private burial. a corker of a concluding scene! a message from charity was a heart warming story about a fluke mental connection between a girl from the past and a guy from the present. which pans out into a weird story of witchcraft accusations in the past and delving into the history pages in the present. a nice story with a heartwarming conclusion.	0
you know how star trek fans flocked to all the star trek movies, even the really bad ones? why? to see their heroes in action one more time. that's the way i feel about doc savage. i am a major fanatic for the character, and the prospect of seeing doc and his crew in an adventure was overwhelming. and the first 20 minutes of the film only heightened that feeling of anticipation. then they decided to crib elements from a number of doc adventures and throw them into this one movie, resulting in a somewhat disjointed film. there's a lot of promise in here, diluted by a number of unfortunate choices (the music, the ""camp"" elements, etc.) but the spirit of doc is there, and that's what those of us familiar with doc and his crew respond to. so, in my long-winded way, what i'm trying to say is that this is not a bad movie: it's just not as good as it should have been. and anyone who is a fan of superman, james bond, indiana jones, buckaroo banzai, and many other characters ought to check this movie out just to become familiar with the hero who provided inspiration for them all.	0
it has said that the movies and baseball both thrived during the great depression. it appears that the grim realities of a nation caught up in the aftermath of this economic disaster created a need for occasional relief for the populace. a temporary escape could be found in the on going soap opera that is baseball.<br /><br />likewise, an occasional excursion of 2 or 3 hours into the darkened auditoriums of the cinema. the presence of a radio in just about everyone's house hold kept depression era america at once attuned to world's events and provided many a drama and (especially) comedy shows for a pleasant interlude from harsh reality.<br /><br />the literature of the time also flourished at all levels. the juvenile reading habits helped to create the comic book as we know it, what with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures. but the comic book just did not magically appear, all fully developed with all the colorful 4 color pages, all by itself. there were mediums that were ancestral to them. obviously,the newspaper comic strip was one parent, providing the visual/narrative method of story telling.<br /><br />the other direct ancestor was the pulp magazine. the inexpensive, prose story publications that carried a great deal of stories of the same adventure characters in on going, though not necessarily serialized, tales. the pulp medium had been around for some decades and introduced us to edgar rice borrough's tarzan and johnston mcculley's zorro. the 1930's brought forth a bumper crop as feature characters like the shadow, the avenger, g8's battle aces and the spider,master of men all found their way to the news stands, among many others.<br /><br />one other was doc savage, a full-blooded super hero of the written story; the covers of the pulps had perhaps, the only ""picture"" of the hero. possessing extraordinary strength, super keen senses and a protean genius class intellect, doc was the prototype super hero.<br /><br />he also assembled 5 of his former army buddies into a small, free lancing team of adventurers. each of them was an expert in a given field. so we had a top rated: chemist, lawyer, construction engineer, electrical engineer, geologist-archaeologist-paleontologist, etc.<br /><br />the doc savage stories were very popular in the 1930's and '40's, and were published into the middle '50's. then they went into a hiatus for a good 12-15 years. then the brainstorm came about to repackage the old novels in new ""container"", the paperback book. a fresh look to the cover art was introduced, featuring a highly stylized series of paintings of a very muscular doc, with a perpetually ripped shirt.<br /><br />the re-introduction proved to be highly successful, with the publication of a title a month (and for a while more). soon, there was a rumor of a doc savage movie! but when, by what producer? well, the venerable ""man of bronze"" was back on the news stands for over 10 years before any real project got put together. it was veteran stop-action animator and producer of top special effects films, geoprge pal, who did the film along with warner brothers.<br /><br />when doc savage, man of bronze arrived in the movie houses, it boasted of a well casted team of actors, albeit a largely ""no name"" as far familiarity with the viewers. with former tarzan of tv,ron ely's nearly perfect casting in the lead, up and coming beauty of a starlette, pamela hensley in the female lead and veteran character paul wexler (as the villainous, captain seas); no other name would have been recognized. and, just maybe that was a plus in this case.<br /><br />the story does a fine job of both getting most of the audience acquainted with the incredible group and at the same time get a plot going. use of narration, by paul frees, and short film clips are the method pursued to move the introduction along to the main body of the story.<br /><br />from the very start, there are hints that this story will go with the same sort of manufactured ""camp"" humor as the batman tv series. some really great looking early scenes involving doc and the whole crew doing their individual specialties are thrown toward humor by the paul frees narration and the unexpected, unlikely outcomes. (for example, an experiment of doc's with a miniature rocket/missile turns out to be part of a method of catching fish, a small one at that.) the whole story unfolds like that, hitting the viewer with a little 'camp' every so often, as to keep reminding us not to take it too seriously. we are also puzzled about mr. george pal's being the producer(his last). he who had been so well known for special effects, surely a factor that could be put to good use in a sci-fi action setting of the pulp character's world.<br /><br />i can remember seeing it quite vividly. mrs. ryan (deanna) was in the hospital, just having given birth to our 2nd child, michelle(08/14/75). our older girl, jennifer, was visiting her grandmother, so after visiting hours were over in the maternity ward, it was straight over to the old marquette theatre, 63rd & kedzie, here in chicago.<br /><br />having seen it and being a guy with a good familiarity with doc, i was sort of let down by the final product. i could accept a little of this 'camp' business, but would not have objected if mr.pal would have seen fit to let it all hang out and have some real neat dinosaurs and volcanoes to give it all a little more pulp/comic/serial type excitement.<br /><br />and yet, the cast, headed-up by mr. ely and the others, made the whole film likable, if not lovable. the sets and locations were, as far as we can see, very much like those of a '30's serial or adventure flick which would be enjoyable to about anyone.<br /><br />and maybe that's just what they were trying for with this doc savage, man of bronze.	0
having read many of the other reviews for this film on the imdb there is ostensibly a consensus amongst purists that this film is nothing like the books upon which it is based. upon this point i cannot comment, having never actually read any of the protagonists adventures previously. however, what i can say with certainty, is that it strikes me that many of the said reviewers must have surely undergone a sense of humour bypass; let's be honest here - this film is just so much fun!<br /><br />ok..so i must concede the point that the film apparently is not representative of the character/s but let's put this into a clear perspective..do the same individuals who are carping on about this film also bemoan the fact that the classic 1960's batman series does not remain faithful to the original dc comic book character? or perhaps is there still unrest in same persons that the 1980 film version of flash gordon was too much of a departure from the original series?<br /><br />the point is, yes this film is incredibly camp but that's precisely its charm!<br /><br />former tarzan, ron ely plays the eponymous hero in this (and bears more than a passing resemblance to gary busey to boot!) and is backed up by a great supporting cast who all look to be having a ball with their respective roles. also look out for a very brief but highly welcome appearance by horror movie favourite michael berryman.<br /><br />best scene? far too many to choose from but check out the hilarious facial expressions adopted by the waiter when savage and his men commit the ultimate faux pas of ordering coke, lemonade and milk at a formal occasion! also the often noted scene near the end of the film wherein savage tackles his nemesis captain seas utilising various martial arts disciplines which are labelled on screen!  priceless!<br /><br />simply put, the film doesn't take itself at all seriously and is all the more fun for it. great fun from start to finish! (and you'll be singing the john phillip sousa adapted theme song for days afterwards guaranteed!)	0
this series is set a year after the mission to abydos in the movie stargate. it explains a lot of the stuff that the movie neglected to mention. such as, how was the stargate activated without a human computer? where did the goa'uld (ra's race) come from? how many are there? <br /><br />the first episode has a retired jack o'neill (spelled with 2 ls) recalled to active duty by general george hammond due to an attack by the shut down stargate from apophis, a powerful goa'uld who killed four men and kidnapped one woman. we meet samantha carter, a brilliant scientist who claims that she should have gone through the stargate the first time, and is determined to go through now. we find out that daniel got married on abydos, and that there are hundreds of gate addresses that they can dial. then daniel's wife gets captured by apophis and becomes his new queen. <br /><br />it continues in the second episode where general hammond announces the formation of the sgc which includes nine teams, in which jack's team will be sg-1 which consists of jack, samantha and daniel. they go to chulak, a goa'uld homeworld to rescue daniel's wife and another one captured at abydos named ska'ra. they get captured, and just as apophis gives the order to kill them and many other prisoners, a jaffa named teal'c, first prime of apophis, saves them and goes to earth with them, where he is made part of sg-1. <br /><br />that was only the beginning of the adventure. in the course of the show they have gone to the past and future, gotten transported to alternate realities, swapped bodies, grown old, met alien races which include a rebel alliance of goa'uld called the tok'ra, in which samantha's dad becomes a member, the asgard, a cute little race in which we see thor most often (he's jack's buddy),and avoid global disaster by the skin of their teeth countless times.<br /><br />the show was recently canceled, but lasted ten seasons. in season nine, a new enemy called the ori came in flaunting brand new powers, new dangers and bringing to light new mysteries surrounding the stargate and its creators, the ancients. season nine and ten also saw the introduction to two new characters, ben browder as cameron mitchell, the new leader of sg-1 and claudia black as vala maldoran, a female human from another world who brings a new sense of fun to the team. <br /><br />very well-produced, interesting characters, fantastic special effects and a subtle love interest between samantha and jack, this one has it all. a different way of travelling the galaxy, and different kinds of adventures, this is one show you don't want to miss. unlock the gate and step through. you won't regret it!	0
***possible spoilers***<br /><br />i recently watched this movie with my 11 year old son and was pleased to see that he laughed in the right places and was thrilled by the action sequences. ron ely is just right as doc. cool, calm, almost always in control(and with an occasional twinkle in his eye). what more can one ask for? i have never read a doc savage book, so i don't know if it is faithful to the source but i enjoyed the light tone and derring-do. many people have compared this movie to raiders of the lost ark, which i don't think is fair. the difference in budget is astounding(raiders must have at least 10 times the budget). doc savage does not have the extensive location work that raiders has. special effects are also at a minimum but come on people, the story is a lot of fun and the humor is just right. the sousa music is catchy(love that theme song- every time i watch the film, i end up humming the theme for days).the best way to approach this film is to just relax and enjoy. highlights include the exciting opening sequence where the fabulous five and doc chase the indian sniper throughout the rooftops of new york and the very funny fight sequence between doc and captain seas. not as good is the villain who sleeps in a giant crib (really!). overall a great movie to watch on a rainy day. i give it 7 out of 10.<br /><br />doc savage, doc savage...thank the lord he's here!	0
most people miss hollywood's point of concept. if a hero can stimulate heroic deeds to the mind of a child, within the confines of the law then i, approve of the lessons being taught by doc savage.<br /><br />in all times of conflict or war, the public and government look for heroes to decorate. the motion picture industry brings heroes to the screen for people to identify with - such as doc savage, james bond, superman, batman, spiderman and others. doc savage is remembered by more than one generation as being the 'best of the best' before james bond, superman or any of the others. all others that follow doc savage are only a part of the character, not the 'man of bronze'.	0
the problem is that the movie rode in on the coattails of the 60's-created concept that comic books could only be done as ""camp"" (i.e., the 60's batman show) for tv and movie. thus you have combat sequences with subtitles (come on!), a cluelessly unromantic doc savage (he was uncomfortable around women in the pulps, not an idiot), monk mayfair in a nightsheet (a scene guaranteed to give you nightmares for several nights), and the totally hokey ending with the secondary bad guy encased in gold like a herve villechez posing for an oscar statute. and when they're not doing booming sousa march scores, the tinkly little ""funny"" music undercuts much of the drama.<br /><br />even as such, this movie is...okay. it's fun, and when it stays serious it's a very accurate representation of the pulps. except for monk, as has been mentioned before: he's hugely muscled, not obese. and long tom, who is supposed to be a pale scrawny guy with an attitude, not paul gleason with an (inexplicable) scarf.<br /><br />the green death sequences, for instance, are remarkably gruesome and not something i'd recommend for children. but they are very close to the feel of the pulps. when the writers and producers get it right, they do get it right - i'll give them that.<br /><br />but if the producers had done doc with the loving care and scripting of, say, reeves' first two superman movies, think what we might have had then. i think the problem is the movie's schizophrenic. there's a definite sense of trying to do a 30's homage, but they're also trying to give in to the ""heroes must be camp"" attitude that batman created. one gets the impression there was a sober, pulp-style first draft and then someone came in and said, ""hey, let's make it funny - it worked with the batman show 8 years ago!""<br /><br />but doc lives on, thanks to earl macrauch and buckaroo banzai. if macrauch ain't doing a homage to doc savage in that movie, the man is truly demented. so when the series actually gets on tv (allegedly mid-season in '99-00), doc savage, updated to the 90's, will live once more.	0
this is a very entertaining movie. a few of the reviews that i have read on this forum have been written by people who, apparently, think that the film was an effort at serious drama. it was not made that way....it is an extremely enjoyable film, performed in a tongue in cheek manner. all of the actors are obviously having fun while entertaining us. the fight sequences are lively, brisk and, above all, not gratuitous. the so-called ""green death"", utilized on a couple of occasions, is not, as i read in one review, ""gruesome"". a couple of reviewers were very critical of the martial arts fight between doc and seas near the end of the film. hey, lighten up... again, i remind one and all that this is a fun film. each phase of this ""fight"" was captioned, which added to the fun aspect. the actors were not trying to emulate bruce lee or jackie chan. this is not one of those martial arts films. ron ely looks great in this film and is the perfect choice to play doc. another nice touch is the unique manner in which the ultimate fate of the ""bad guy"" (seas) is dealt with. i promise you that if you don't try to take this film very seriously and simply watch it for the entertainment value, you will spend 100 minutes in a most enjoyable manner.	0
outragously entertaining period piece set in the 30s, it is a spin on the classic cliffhanger series, as much as ""raiders of the lost ark"", only done on a low budget and much campier by director michael anderson. the opening scenes laces liberal amount of gothic art nuveau, predating batman by two decades. starring ron ely (tarzan) as a perfectly cast hero and the gorgeous pamela hensley as the local latina mona tagging on to our hero on a goldhunt in the non-existent latin american country of hidalgo. best line, our hero to mona, holding a fist to her chin just as you expect him to be tender with her and give her a hug: ""mona, you're a brick!""<br /><br />paul wexler's ham-and-cheese blackhat, captain seas is a an absolute delight. expect a little ""raiders.."", a dash of ""batman"", a little ""the lost world"", a little ""lost horizons"" and a whole lot of campiness and you'll get it just right. watch out for cult favorite michael berryman in a small part as undertaker and enjoy the campy use of john philip sousa's patriotic music. a prime candidate for dvd release, it is certainly overdue. an unmissable treat for the whole family. 9/10	0
i was brought up on doc savage,and was petrified by the green death as a child but even then as now, i found it thoroughly entertaining.i have made countless friends and colleagues watch this film and have been most amused by the diversity of reactions,granted they mostly think i'm odd but there you are. ""i don't know what it is about the doc, but he always gets the girls"" has to be the ultimate line when you look at his sad band of men. this film is a classic spoof on all the super hero genre,and was way before it's time,it is not to be taken seriously, move over austin powers. ron ely is a god.it is unfortunate that this film hasn't been released on dvd in the uk. i don't think it should be remade and bastardised, like i said it's a classic,it cannot be done without ron.(like the italian job without mini's and michael caine). i give it 10/10.	0
we so often talk of cinema landmarks - kane, the godfather, a bout de souffle. one film however is too often overlooked by ""serious"" film critics. i am talking of course about the classic doc savage (m.o.b.)<br /><br />this film is not only exciting but also seriously explores the issue of exploitation of the developing nations by us imperialism. not to mention kung-fu.<br /><br />it also possessed the greatest soundtrack in film history (until of course queen's breathtaking work on flash gordon). although a bit of a rarity, this film is well worth seeking out - it will repay the effort of your search ten-fold.	0
given the title, this first follow-up to quartet (1948) obviously reduces the number of w. somerset maugham stories which comprise the film. the author still turns up to introduce the episodes, but there’s no epilogue this time around; by the way, while the script of the original compendium gave sole credit to r.c. sheriff, here maugham himself also lent a hand in the adaptation, as well as noel langley (though it’s unclear whether they contributed one segment each or else worked in unison). as can be expected, much of the crew of quartet has been retained for the second installment – though this also extends to at least three cast members, namely naunton wayne, wilfrid hyde-white and felix aylmer (the last two had bit parts in the episode from quartet entitled “the colonel’s lady”). while trio ultimately emerges to be a lesser achievement than its predecessor (slightly unbalanced by the third story which takes up more than half the running-time), it’s still done with the utmost care, acted with verve by a stellar cast and is solidly enjoyable into the bargain.<br /><br />“the verger” tells of a church sexton (james hayter) – for which the story’s title is another word – who’s dismissed after 17 years of service by the new parish priest (michael hordern) simply because he’s illiterate. rather than rest on his laurels, despite his age, he not only takes a wife (his landlady, played by kathleen harrison) but opens a tobacconist shop strategically placed in a lengthy stretch of road where no such service is offered – and, with business flourishing, this is developed into a whole chain. the last scene, then, sees him pay a visit to bank manager felix aylmer who, not only is surprised to learn of hayter’s lack of education, but is prompted to ask him what his other interests were – to which the wealthy (and respected) tobacconist replies, with some measure of irony, that he had the calling to be a verger! <br /><br />the second episode, “mr. know-all”, is the shortest but also perhaps the most engaging: a voyage at sea is utterly beleaguered by the insufferable presence of a pompous young man (nigel patrick), british despite his foreign-sounding name of kelada, who professes to be an authority on virtually every subject under the sun. naunton wayne and wilfrid hyde-white are the two passengers who have to put up with him the most – the latter because he shares a cabin with the man and the former in view of patrick’s attentions to his pretty wife (anne crawford). during a fancy-dress party, however, the passengers decide to enact their ‘revenge’ on kelada by having one of them impersonate him (a jest which he naturally doesn’t appreciate)!; still, it’s here that he contrives to show a decent side to his character – told by crawford that the necklace she’s wearing is an imitation, wayne challenges patrick to name its price…but the latter realizes immediately that it’s the genuine article and that this would compromise crawford’s position if he were to tell, so kelada allows himself to be publicly ridiculed rather than expose the fact that the woman probably has a secret admirer! <br /><br />as can also be deduced from the title, “sanatorium” deals with the myriad patients at such a place – run by andre' morell; the protagonist is a new intern, roland culver, who wistfully observes the various goings-on. the narrative, in fact, highlights in particular three separate strands of plot – one humorous (the ‘feud’ between two aged scots long resident at the sanatorium, played by finlay currie and john laurie), one melodramatic (the erratic relationship between disgruntled patient raymond huntley and long-suffering but devoted wife betty ann davies) and one bittersweet (the romance between naïve but charming jean simmons and dashing cad michael rennie which, in spite of having pretty much everything against it including the fact that morell has diagnosed simmons as a ‘lifer’ while rennie only has a few years left to him, leads the couple to the altar).	0
trio's vignettes were insightful and quite enjoyable. it was curious seeing so many soon to be famous actors when they were very young. the performances and attention to detail were wonderful to watch.<br /><br />observation. in film it isn't necessary that source material be in alignment with the contemporary era to be interesting or worthwhile. ""small morality"" storytelling is quaint (or coy) only in the eye of the beholder--thankfully. story content--well told--can overcome it's time, subject or place.<br /><br />ironically, there are quite a few contemporary films today that have not overcome the conventions or cutting edge mores of the present era. inserting ""small morality"" content--occasionally--might provide a dimension lacking.	0
a message movie, but a rather good one. outstanding cast, top to bottom. interesting in that bette davis's plot line is essentially back story! the extremely negative reviews (name throwing at the screenplay/playwright, associating this somehow with extremely negative comments about 'angles in america', etc. etc.) object to the movie being too preachy about germany in wwii. gosh, that is just a bit too sophisticated an understanding of morality for me.<br /><br />theatrical and movie-making, and acting styles vary over time and of course 70 years later this particular movie would not be made in this way. yes casablanca is a better movie (i guess), but although made in the same year and both having nazis in them, casablanca is primarily a love story. the love story in this movie takes second seat to the spy plot--more of a thriller. both have a rather large number of somewhat cheesy accents and wonderful character actors. the children are a bit tedious and could have been edited	0
this is actually a trilogy of 3 of somerset maugham's short tales. the first one is the verger, which is about 15 minutes long and very enjoyable. after 17 years albert foreman is laid off from his church job because he can't read nor write. so what does he do? opens a tobacco shop, of course!<br /><br />the second is mr. know-all which was actually a story i had read for school 6 years ago and instantly forgotten, until i heard the familiar introduction. another 15 minute one, and also very good. it worked better on film than in a book for me, but then perhaps that's because i was only 14 the last time, afterall.<br /><br />the 3rd one is nearly a let-down. almost an hour in length, it simply drags. it's not all that bad, but not as quick and snappy as the last 2. i watched the first quarter hour of it and then skipped forward to the last quarter hour, and found that it still made sense and really i hadn't missed a thing!<br /><br />overall i give them 8, 9, and 6 out of 10, respectively.	0
made after quartet was, trio continued the quality of the earlier film versions of the short stories by maugham. here the three stories are the verger, mr. know-it-all, and sanitorium. the first two are comic (the verger is like a prolonged joke, but one with a good pay-off), and the last more serious (as health issues are involved). again the author introduces the film and the stories.<br /><br />james hayter, soon to have his signature role as samuel pickwick, is the hero in the verger. he holds this small custodial-type job in a church, but the new vicar (michael hordern) is an intellectual snob. when he hears hayter has no schooling he fires him. hayter has saved some money, so he tells his wife (kathleen harrison) he fancies buying a small news and tobacco shop. he has a good eye, and his store thrives. soon he has a whole chain of stores. when his grandchild is christened by hordern, the latter is amazed to see how prosperous his ex-verger. the payoff is when bank manager felix aylmer meets with hayter about diversifying his investments. i'll leave it to you to hear the unintentional but ironic coda of the meeting.<br /><br />according to maugham he met a man like max kelada (nigel patrick) on a cruise. in mr. know-it-all kelada is a splashy, friendly, and slightly overbearing type from the middle east who is on a business trip (regarding jewelry) by steamship. his state-room mate is mr. grey (the ever quiet and proper wilfred hyde-white) who is somewhat, silently disapproving of max. max likes to enliven things, and soon is heavily involved in the ship's entertainment. at this point the story actually resembles part of the plot of the non-maugham story and film china seas (1935), as max makes a bet that he can tell a real piece of jewelry from a fake (after insisting that a piece of jewelry he spotted is real). i won't describe the way max rises to the occasion.<br /><br />sanitorium is the longest segment. roland culver plays ""ashenden"" (the fictional alter-ego of maugham - a writer and one time spy as in hitchcock's the secret agent). here he has to use a sanitorium for a couple of months for his health. he finds a remarkable crew of people, including jean simmons as a frail but beautiful young woman, finlay currie as an irascible scotsman, john laurie as a second irascible scotsman who is ""at war"" with currie, raymond huntley as a quiet patient who only shows his internal anger at his situation when his wife shows up, and michael rennie as a young man who has a serious life threatening illness. culver watches as three stories among these characters play out to their conclusions. the last, dealing with simmons and rennie, is ironic but deeply moving.<br /><br />it was a dandy follow-up to the earlier quartet, and well worth watching.	0
wilhelm grimm (alexander knox) stands trial for nazi crimes. three witnesses give evidence - father warecki (henry travers), wilhelm's brother karl (erik rolf) and wilhelm's former lover marja (marsha hunt) - before wilhelm speaks in his own defense. the film ends after the court sums up....<br /><br />the film is told in three flashback segments as each of the witnesses takes the stand. the story is mostly set in a small polish village and memorable scenes include the village reaction to the death of anna (shirley mills), who wilhelm is accused of raping; the treatment of the jewish villagers as they prepare to be moved to concentration camps; and the church service where willie grimm (richard crane) denounces his nazi upbringing whilst mourning for his girlfriend janina (dorothy morris), marja's daughter, after she has been shot at a brothel.<br /><br />throughout the film, knox is unrepentant and is very convincing as a bitter, resentful and evil man. martha hunt has some powerful moments and matches him with her strength and henry travers is also very good in his role as a priest. this film delivers an effective story that stays with you once it has finished.	0
this was a wonderful little american propaganda film that is both highly creative and openly discusses the nazi atrocities before the entire extent of the death camps were revealed. while late 1944 and into 1945 would reveal just how evil and horrific they were, this film, unlike other hollywood films to date, is the most brutally honest film of the era i have seen regarding nazi atrocities.<br /><br />the film begins in a courtroom in the future--after the war is over (the film was made in 1944--the war ended in may, 1945). in this fictitious world court, a nazi leader is being tried for war crimes. wilhelm grimm is totally unrepentant and one by one witnesses are called who reveal grimm's life since 1919 in a series of flashbacks. at first, it appears that the film is going to be sympathetic or explain how grimm was pushed to join the nazis. however, after a while, it becomes very apparent that grimm is just a sadistic monster. these episodes are amazingly well done and definitely hold your interest and also make the film seem less like a piece of propaganda but a legitimate drama.<br /><br />all in all, the film does a great job considering the film mostly stars second-tier actors. there are many compelling scenes and performances--especially the very prescient jewish extermination scene towards the end that can't help but bring you close to tears. it was also interesting how around the same point in the film there were some super-creative scenes that use crosses in a way you might not notice at first. overall, it's a must-see for history lovers and anyone who wants to see a good film.<br /><br />fyi--this is not meant as a serious criticism of the film, but hitler was referred to as ""that paper hanger"". this is a reference to the myth that hitler had once made money putting up wallpaper. this is in fact not true--previously he'd been a ""starving artist"", homeless person and served well in the german army in wwi. a horrible person, yes, but never a paper hanger!	0
never viewed this film until recently on tcm and found this story concerning poland and a small town which had to suffer with the nazi occupation of the local towns just like many other european cities for example: norway. the first world war was over and people in this town were still suffering from their lost soldiers and the wounded which war always creates. alexander knox, ( wilhelm gimm)""gorky park"" returns from the war with a lost leg and was the former school teacher in town. he was brought up a german and was not very happy with the polish people and they in turn did not fully accept him either. as the hitler party grew to power wilhelm grimm desired to become a nazi in order to return and punish this small polish town for their treatment towards him which was really all in his mind. marsha hunt,(marja pacierkowski),""chloe's prayer"", played an outstanding role as a woman who lost her husband and was romantically involved with whilhelm gimm. there are many flashbacks and some very real truths about how the nazi destroyed people's families and their entire lives. the cattle cars are shown in this picture with jewish people heading to the nazi gas chambers. if you have not seen this film, and like this subject matter, give it some of your time; this film is very down to earth for a 1944 film and a story you will not forget too quickly.	0
the only reason i give this movie an 8 out of 10 is because there are few movies, in my opinion, that are perfect. this little b picture is a taut story, well told. i've always been intrigued by alexander knox, but have seen him very few movies. here he plays wilhelm grimm, a sad little man who turns into a monster. he betrays everything and everybody without an ounce of remorse. the performance is one of the most chilling performances i've ever seen. since world war 2, actors who played nazis or other evil types in films have occasionally been nominated for oscars. i imagine that since this was made during the war, the academy felt like honoring a performance like this would have been like honoring evil. but knox puts in that kind of performance--a man so bitter and consumed by guilt that he thinks nothing of making others suffer. i still can't get over it.<br /><br />marsha hunt, who usually plays the filbert gibbet or social butterfly, is cast against type in probably the best performance i've ever seen her give, too. maybe not oscar worthy, but the best of her career. nothing against her; i have enjoyed her in those ""slight"" roles she often played. but here she proves she up to the task of heavier drama.<br /><br />if you like human drama stories, or stories about the fates of those who suffered at the hands of the nazis, i highly recommend this fine little film.	0
this one is tough to watch -- as an earlier reviewer says. that is amazing considering the terrible films that came out right after wwii -- particularly the ""liberation"" of dachau. it is clear that, as of the middle of the war, we knew exactly what was happening to the jews. the sequence that shows a ""transport"" is vivid, almost as if based upon an actual newsreel (the nazis liked to record their atrocities). knox as the nazi is brilliant. he charts the course of a nazi career. that charting is particularly telling when contrasted with the reactions of other germans, at first laughing at hitler, then incredulous, and finally helpless. that contrast, however, permits us to believe in the ""conversion"" of one young nazi officer to an anti-nazi stance. that did happen, as witness the several attempts against hitler, most notably the staffenberg plot which occurred as this film was coming out. a strong film, effectively using flashbacks, accurately predicting the nuremburg trails and others that would occur once the war ended.	0
this movie was extremely funny, i would like to own this for my vintage collection of 1970s movie must see again list, i know this cast of characters ,they are people that i have met over the years and that prompt me to search out this comedy, unfortunately this was never put to dvd or vhs. redd foxx always a clown of comedy, pearl baily a great match as his wife witty and sassy, norman a son with a secret not sure if he will have a future if it is out,dennis dugan crazy funny man . miss dobson hooker with a heart and little conscience. love,lust,strange family ties this movie qualifies for a come back encore performance ,situation comedy with a mix of events as this could and should find its way as a remake, i do think finding cast would be extremely difficult maybe impossible,except jerry seinfeld playing dennis dugan role, this earmarks a couple of seinfeld episodes that also brought me back to norman is that you ,keeping them in the closest was surely impossible as impossible to reform pretend hooker girl friend and infidelity of a parent. this movie was a wild ride advise of a cabbie, remind me of episode kramer takes advice of his caddie over his lawyer. ( episode from seinfeld ) the parents have there jaw dropping moment, fun over fun it is screaming bring me back .	0
norman, is that you? was (this is all third hand, so take it with a grain of salt) adapted to an african american family from a jewish one, when it made the transition off stage and onto screen. also, it was one of those movies originally filmed in video, so the prints from the theater can't have been that great. still, performances by redd foxx and others were pretty good. <br /><br />what i wanted to tell you all is that the movie is a period piece: it reflected the attitudes in the mid to early 70s about finding out you have a gay son or daughter in your family. for that reason alone, it's pretty interesting- if not a little ""hollywood"". don't believe me? check out lines about curtains, etc. very stereotypical. not too deep.<br /><br />but... the movie really shines in a couple of areas. there is a side splitting scene when redd foxx is trying to find his wife, who's run away with his brother (!) to ensenada in a souped up pinto. the phone conversation across the border is really memorable. <br /><br />but... the best scene in the movie is when wayland flowers and madame did his/their gay routine that he used to do in gay bars and nightclubs. to the best of my knowledge, this is the only time that routine was filmed. and, it's a slightly cleaned up and much shorter version, i'm told. still, it's vintage madame, and shouldn't be missed. people are still stealing lines from wayland; the man was truly gifted. enjoy the movie!	0
i saw a trailer for this on afro promo, the collection of movie trailers for movies featuring african-americans. it looked like what it is; a highly tendentious ""wacky"" comedy in which an uptight black man realizes that his son is gay. it would seem that redd foxx's (rf) wife has left him for his brother, who works with him at ""the store"" back in phoenix. he has taken the bus to visit his son norman is los angeles.<br /><br />so as rf arrives, norman, wearing nothing but powder-blue bikini shorts, gets out of his waterbed to answer the door. trying to buy time by making his elderly father take the stairs to what appears to be the 60th floor, norman tries to wake his lover, who steadfastly refuses to budge. it was just to the point where i wrote ""why won't he wake up?"" when suddenly he does, and me and my friend's jaws dropped for the first of many times as we are presented with our first glimpse of the blue-eyed, swirl-hairdoed garson, norman's white live-in lover, who just ""had the most faaaaaabulous dream"" garson is a flaming queen of a type that can only be imagined as emerging from 1976 l.a. he has dresses and a purse and big clunky jewelry, and seems to have modeled both his look and persona on carol brady from the brady bunch.<br /><br />norman orders his lover to find somewhere else to stay during his father's visit. garson goes to stay with waylon flowers, and madam answers the phone when norman calls. <br /><br />so rf attempts to reach his wife in mexico. while he is on the phone, garson comes in to pack his dress and rf confronts him. with a burst of 70s soul music meant to evoke his dawning revelation (but sounding more like we're about to hear a very special track by the emotions), he realizes that his son is gay.<br /><br />his first impulse is ""i'll kill him. i'll kill him."" then rf goes on a long walk, wherein he cycles through all of the thoughts a confused parent might have, such as ""maybe we toilet trained him too soon."" his thoughts are all triggered by something he sees on his walk, for instance a burly truck driver appearing just as he is contemplating what makes a real man. surprisingly, he goes to a bookstore and buys about eight books on homosexuality. this, it must be said, is about eight more books on homosexuality than my parents bought. he then goes straight to a park bench and reads them all! <br /><br />rf then hires audrey, a six-foot amazon prostitute (in this amazing fur thing) played by tamara dobson of cleopatra jones. he hired her for norman to try out heterosexuality, but this pisses norman and he storms out to go stay with his friend melody.<br /><br />then garson comes over and offers to take rf out for the night. he commiserates over the loss of rf's wife, and tells the tale of his own mother, who harbors an irrational prejudice against pilippinos because ""she was molested at a luau."" they attend a long featured performance of wayon and madam, which culminates in madam violently bashing her head against the piano until her hair comes loose. once more, mouths were agape.<br /><br />so it seems that, wouldn't ya just know it, rf and garson have a wonderful evening together! you see, staid, traditional older black men just have to see the crappy, highly-effeminate entertainment of mega-queens in order to come around to all the gay world has to offer! it's really just that simple! this still does not prevent rf from yelling ""rape!"" when garson wakes him from a bad dream. it ends less predictably than you'd think.<br /><br />there was so much that was just off. what is the basis of norman and garson 's relationship? they don't seem to have any rapport, and norman has no qualms whatsoever about kicking garson out, and even when he comes around to stand up for himself, he never defends garson or talks about their relationship. there were some kind of sweetly quaint touches like rf going to buy all those books on homosexuality-and sitting right down on the park bench to read them! i like the idea that a parent would actually try to find something out about homosexuality, rather than just run off to get drunk or commiserate with his friends.<br /><br />other than that, it's kind o"	0
"when i first saw ""a cry in the dark"", i had no idea what the plot was. but when i saw it, i was shocked at what it portrayed. when i saw it a second time in an australian cinema class, i realized a second point: communication issues. you see, when a dingo snatched lindy chamberlain's (meryl streep) baby, she and her husband michael (sam neill) were grief-stricken but didn't show it. as seventh day adventists, they believed that god willed this to happen, and so they couldn't mourn it. but when people all over australia saw their lack of sadness, everyone started believing that lindy did it herself.<br /><br />the point is, the wrong message got communicated to the public, and it turned people against lindy. even though this was a pure accident, it still happened. it may be one of the biggest disasters resulting from the existence of mass media, regardless of any media outlet's political views.<br /><br />as for the performances, streep does a very good job with an australian accent (no surprise there), and sam neill is equally great. you will probably get blown away just by what you see here. definitely one of fred schepisi's best movies ever."	0
meryl streep was incredible in this film. she has an amazing knack for accents, and she shows incredible skill in this film overall. i really felt for her when lindy was being persecuted. she was played realistically, too. she got cranky, upset, and unpleasant as the media and the government continued their unrelenting witchhunt. i didn't expect much from the film initially, but i really got interested in it, and the movie is based on a real person and real events. it turned out to be better than i had anticipated. sam neill was also outstanding; this is the best work i've seen from him, and i've really liked him in other movies (the piano, for example). i gave the film a 7, but if i could rate just the acting, i'd give the it a 9.5, and a perfect 10 for streep.	0
"a cry in the dark"" is a masterful piece of cinema, haunting, and incredibly though provoking. the true story of lindy chamberland, who, in 1980, witnessed a horrific sight, seeing her 3-month-old baby being brutally taken from their family's tent, while camping on the austrailian outback. azaria (the baby) was never seen again, and the result of her horrendous disappearance caused a true life frenzy all around the world. meryl streep does immaculate justice to the role of lindy, as she always does. but the one thing that helps ""a cry in the dark"" never fall flat is the brilliant direction. a truly inspired and accurate outlook on this baffeling case, tears are brought to the eyes. the concept is nothing less then terrifying, and afterwards you are left haunted, but also inspired.	0
watch on the rhine is one of the best anti-nazi propaganda films made during world war two. paul lukas was certainly deserving of his oscar. bette davis shines brilliantly as the great actress and beauty she was. i would recommend this film to those interested in that era, and, of course, the fabulous films of the late, great, ms. bette davis.	0
some movies seem to be made before we are ready for them. as i watched this film, made in 1988, in 1999, i thought i was watching the o.j. simpson debacle (although i have very different opinions about the innocence of the individuals in each situation).<br /><br />the australian news media, if this movie is to be believed, devoured the case of a possible infanticide and truth was left as an afterthought. it was scary to see the scenes of invasive, swarming media hordes, ridiculous accounts of half-truths and lies and debates over the supposed merits of the case by persons at all levels of society.<br /><br />equally appalling is the media's depiction as indifferent and uncomprehending of the technical information in the case. i do wish more was made of the issue of religious prejudice in the case (the accused are seven-day adventists).<br /><br />today these circuses have become common but that makes the lesson only more important.<br /><br />streep is excellent as usual, and this is the best i've ever seen sam neill. the aussie accents get a bit thick at times but not incomprehensible.	0
this is an extremely-powerful based-on-a-true story film that can be infuriating to watch. i say that because how brutal a hounding press can be to people, in this case an innocent australian couple charged with killing their baby.<br /><br />meryl streep received a lot of recognition for her performance when this film came out but i thought sam neill was just as good. let's just say they both were excellent but the role was little harder for streep because she had to learn an australian accent. (she learned it so well i had trouble understanding her in parts.)<br /><br />without giving anything away, all i can say is this movie will wear you out emotionally.	0
roll is a wonderful little film. toby malone plays an 18 year old kid (very well acted, by the way) who is into soccer. malone's cousin takes him out the night before his big game on an adventure with many twists and turns involving two gym bags, a drug lord, some tough bikers, some cops, and some prostitutes ... and the movie keeps us guessing as to which characters are on which side of the law, what the contents of either gym bag is, and even what gender a key biker is. parts of it reminded me of lock stock and two smoking barrels.<br /><br />for me, roll reinforced three opinions that i already held before seeing roll. those opinions are: 1. i really want to visit australia one day. the country and cities are beautiful and it looks like such a cool place for a vacation.<br /><br />2. some of the best filmmakers in the are australian. the cinematography in roll was especially impressive. i loved the stylized colors and lighting in many of the scenes.<br /><br />3. australian women are hot!	0
mat spirogolou's (toby malone) family know he is a talented footballer, and are pleased when he secures an audition to join a big club. they hope that when he arrives in the city his cousin will look after him.<br /><br />but the cousins are like chalk and cheese: one a naive farm boy, the other a streetwise spendthrift who has managed to get mixed up with drug dealers and gangsters. mat is unlikely to have a quiet evening in before his big day.<br /><br />having missed his cousin george (damien robertson) on arrival in the city, mat encounters further trouble when a young biker takes him for a ride in more ways than one.<br /><br />toby malone, probably better known for his work in theatre, puts in a commendable performance as the bucolic teenager. there are telltale signs of a low budget, but as with so many other low-budget movies there's more fun, seemingly more spontaneity, and more charm, than there is to be seen in the average hollywood blockbuster.	0
i just sat through a very enjoyable fast paced 45 mins of roll.<br /><br />roll is about a country boy, mat (toby malone) who has dreams of becoming a sports star. mat travels to the city and is to be picked up by his cousin george (damien robertson). well, that was the plan anyway. george is involved with a gangster, tiny (john batchelor) and is making a delivery for him. needless to say, mat gets dragged into george's world. <br /><br />i thought it was great how mat teaches george some morals and respect while george teaches mat how to relax and enjoy life a little. toby and damien were well cast together and did an outstanding job.<br /><br />every character in the movie complimented each other very well, the two cops were great. david ngoombujarra brought some great comic relief to the movie. tiny played a likable gangster that reminded me of one of my favourite characters 'pando' from two hands.<br /><br />one of the other things that i liked about roll was that it showcased the cities that i grew up and lived in for 20 years, perth and fremantle. it was good to see sights and landmarks that i grew up with, especially the old ferris wheel.<br /><br />this rocks 'n' rolls	0
a country-boy aussie-rules player (mat) goes to the city the night before an all-important afl trial match, where he is to be picked up by his cousin. and then things go wrong.<br /><br />his no-hoper cousin has become mixed up in a drug deal involving local loan-shark / drug-dealer tiny (who looks like any gangster anywhere but is definitively australian). needless to say, mat becomes enmeshed in the chaos, and it isn't long before thoughts of tomorrow's match are shunted to the back of his mind as the night's frantic events unravel.<br /><br />accomplished western australian professional shakespearean actor toby malone puts in a sterling performance as young naive country-boy mat, and successfully plays a part well below his age. best support comes from john batchelor as tiny, and an entertaining role by david ngoombujarra as one of the cops following the events. roll is fast-paced, often funny, and a very worthwhile use of an hour.	0
i've just watched roll and what a pleasure it turned out to be. toby malone's performance really stood out, i found myself actually caring about what happens to matt throughout the whole of the film, which itself is a lot of fun, very pacey with a good mix of well rounded characters, quite an achievement considering it's short running time. there are plenty of good twists throughout as well, it will keep you guessing until the end. other characters to watch out for are the totally insane tiny and the sneaky attractive jesse. it may not have the huge budget of a hollywood blockbuster but don't let that put you off, you could do a lot worse than checking this out, you won't regret it. good fun. 7/10	0
a film i expected very little from, and only watched to pass a quiet hour - but what an hour it turned out to be. roll is an excellent if none-too-serious little story of 'country-boy-lost-in-the-big-city-makes-good', it is funny throughout, the characters are endearing and the pace is just right.<br /><br />toby malone is the true star of the film with his endearing portrayal of matt, said country boy and local aussie rules football hero come to the big city to try out for one of the big teams. he is supported superbly by john batchelor as local gangster tiny. watch out for these two.<br /><br />highly recommended.	0
this film is an hour or so of good entertainment and has some genuinely funny moments. i loved the character of matt, and also tiny. they seemed the most engaging and funny characters, and certainly the most interesting. matt is very good (as is his no good cousin), and the police woman and the blonde biker woman provide some welcome eye candy. i must say i saw striking similarities between matt and another aussie actor, eric bana. my personal favourite part was the brothel scene, loved that. overall, i liked the film and it'll get about an 8 rating. the penalty however, i was disappointed in. it was a side foot curl, rather than the appropriate laces blast.<br /><br />i am of course kidding. :)	0
plato's run is an entertaining b movie with gary busey.it is a fairly unknown film so one i saw it at a car boot i thought this looks entertaining i was right to.gary busey plays plato smith a tough mercenary who is framed for the assassination of a powerful cuban crime lord now on the run plato must survive long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends played by steve bauer (scarface) and action star jeff speaksman (the expert). what i liked about plato's run was the way the film never got boring the plot may have been done before but it was still good the acting was fun to watch and the action was quite fun as well especially the climax gary busey makes a good hero ironic since he normally plays the bad guy and steve bauer is good as plato's sidekick even jeff speaksman makes a good performance and he cant even act well to finish it of plato's run is an enjoyable effort from nu image films and i give it 7 out of 10	0
""a wrong-doer is often a man that has left something undone, not always he that has done something.""--emperor marcus aurelius <br /><br />the dvd release of ""watch on the rhine"" could not come at a better moment. it restores to us a major lillian hellman play stirringly adapted to the screen by dashiell hammett (hellman scholar bernard f. dick's audio commentary affirms his authorship). it presents a subtle performance by bette davis, who took a subdued secondary role long after she'd become the workhorse queen at the warner bros. lot. equally significantly, it reminds us that world war ii had a purpose.<br /><br />sure, you say, like we needed that. we've heard cary grant sermonizing in ""destination tokyo"" (1943) about japanese boys and their bushido knives. we've watched jackboots stomp the living hills in ""the sound of music"" (1965). we've toured an england callously occupied by germany in ""it happened here"" (1966). yet, truth to tell, we still need the message spread.<br /><br />i have an 81-year-old friend who curses franklin roosevelt regularly. he feels that fdr connived the u.s. into a foreign fight we didn't need, and thereby caused the death of his favorite cousin. he's encouraged in his demonizing of allied leaders and the trivializing of war two by patrick buchanan.<br /><br />the political columnist has freshly released a fat book heavy with detailed research which claims that adolf hitler would have posed no further menace to poland, europe, or the world if only the third reich had been handed the free city of danzig in 1939. buchanan holds that if those selfish poles hadn't confronted the nazis, drawing in foolishly meddling britain and giddily altruistic france, no war would have engulfed the west. he believes that without the rigors of total war, no one in germany would have built gas chambers to provide a final solution to the jewish problem.<br /><br />some commenters on this site feel that ""watch"" sags under the weight of stale propaganda. maybe. however, neither my friend nor pat buchanan seem to have gotten the film's point: some people hurt and kill to grab other people's land, goods, and liberty; such people dominated the axis powers and ""enough"" didn't appear in their vocabulary.<br /><br />paul lukas deserved the oscar he won. he and bette davis put convincing passion into their portrayals of refugees who fight oppressors. they give emotional punch to the intellectual case for stepping off the sidelines, for actively facing down torturers and murderers. bernard dick notes that hellman didn't care for lukas as a person since he stayed apolitical. of course, as a hungarian he had seen first-hand bela kun's bloody ""dictatorship of the proletariat"" replace an outmoded empire and then topple to admiral horthy's right-wing tyranny.<br /><br />in a marvelous cameo role added to the play by hammett, henry daniell sardonically depicts a wehrmacht officer of the class that disdains the brown shirts he serves. his phili von ramme would doubtless stand with field marshal rommel in 1944 during the plot of july 20th against hitler. in april 1940, however, he pragmatically abets the nazi cause, although he insults herr blecher ""the butcher"" and scorns the rumanian aristocrat teck de brancovis for trying to peddle information on an underground leader.<br /><br />teck, a pauper and possible cuckold, wishes cash and a visa to return to europe where he can resume the shreds of a life that had come undone with the empire-shattering great war and the greater world-wide economic depression. he has no political convictions, no scruples about trading a freedom fighter for his own tomorrow. mercury theater graduate george coulouris lends this burnt-out case's old world cynicism an edge of desperate menace.<br /><br />lucille watson gives winsome vitality to the grasping man's hostess, a domineering old gal who knows her mind and gets her way--but who doesn't adequately appreciate her children and their achievements outside the home she controls. she and her pallid office-bound son belong to the american version of von ramme's and de brancovis' privileged kind. however, this family hasn't seen ruin and never will. they're moneyed people who could silently advance evil simply by not opposing it.<br /><br />this mother and son might easily make choices which would reflect that complaisance toward national socialism and fascism which flourishes today in my friend and in pundit buchanan. ""watch on the rhine"" has a manicured period look. its dialogue reflects its erudite origins on the stage rather than sounding fresh from the streets. yet hellman and hammett's film has gut-based power. audiences still need to hear and heed its call to arms against grabbers relentlessly on the march.	0
the previous reviewer has said it exactly. i saw it once, was enchanted, saw it a second time when it was re-broadcast within a week or two of the first airing. i still remember some of the scenes. the setting is the opening of the 20th century, the war referred to in the title is world war i. one of the scenes was set in a women-only section of a public place, which was an interesting historical note. the moment when one of the women first touches the other is one of my all-time great movie moments. i don't think of this as a ""gay movie,"" it's an interesting and tender period love story, where the two principals happen to be women. i would love to see this movie again; i would buy this one if it ever came out on dvd.	0
as with all the other reviewers, this movie has been a constant in my mind after 30 years. i recall going to the library researching all that i could on this story. i even wrote to the pbs station for more information. despite all this, all i was able to find out was that it was a story printed in a newspaper in the early part of the 1900s.<br /><br />fastward to 2002, after years of searching ebay for on a weekly basis and there it was, a vhs copy of the movie. there was one other bidder but i was determined to win this movie. the losing bidder wrote me asking for a copy which i gave her. despite owning a copy, i still searched and searched finally finding a site that sold a dvd copy of the movie. you can find it at: http://www.johntopping.com/harvey%20perr/war%20widow/war_widow.html	0
i saw this movie in 1976, my first year of living in new york. i went on to live there for the next 26 years,but never saw anything as delicate and beautiful again as this small tv movie. it was part of a pbs series as i recall, and i've never forgotten it. <br /><br />there are no sex scenes to speak of, just delicate, moving, extraordinarily touching moments full of tension and excitement, all set within a conservative, boston (i think), world war 1 environment where women played the role of devoted wife awaiting the return of husband from the war, and did not seek out a career and financial independence. frances lee mccain is superb in the role of career photographer and i have spent the next 30 odd years searching for her in equally challenging roles to no avail.<br /><br />there has to be a video of this movie? sure it should be on dvd but surely at least a video?	0
almost 30 years later i recall this original pbs film as almost unbearably tender. periodically, i check here at imdb hoping that someone has had the good sense to purchase the rights and put it on a dvd. it's september of 2004, and i keep hoping -- deep sigh.<br /><br />one of the two lead actors went on to a small career primarily in a prime-time evening soap; the other, frances lee mccain, was seen in small roles here and there for a few years. but nothing they did before or after ever matched this little movie which was produced, as i recall it, on a short-lived pbs series which showcased original screenplays by new and up-and-coming playwrights.<br /><br />i watched it every time it was shown on pbs, maybe 2 or 3 times. that was before the era of vcrs, so i have no record of it, except in my mind's eye.<br /><br />12/31/2006 addition to above: happy new year, ladies! this wonderful film is finally available on dvd at ladyslipper.org. my understanding is that the dvds are burned from the writer's own personal copy.	0
it's been a while since i've watched this movie, and the series, but now i'm refreshing my memory! this was a very funny movie based on the classic series! johnny knoxville and seann william scott were hilarious together. bo and luke duke help uncle jesse run moonshine in the general lee. when boss hogg forces the dukes off their farm, bo and luke sneak around hogg's local construction site and find samples of coal. they soon realize that boss hogg is gonna strip-mine hazzard county, unless the dukes can stop him, with the help of their beautiful cousin, daisy. my only two problems with the movie was that burt reynolds wasn't right for the part of boss hogg, and sheriff rosco p. coltrane was way too serious. other than that, i highly recommend the dukes of hazzard!!!	0
what is wrong with you people, if you weren't blown away by the action car sequences and jessica simpsons hot body then you are majorly screwed in the head. of course the film isn't a masterpiece, i don't think it was aiming to be. it was fun and funny, i never watched the show when i was younger, i only recently saw one episode, and when i watched the movie, i felt it had the same kind of atmosphere. the movie seats were practically shaking, and the car sequences were good because it didn't bore me and drag out like some of the scenes in 2fast 2furious. and jessica simpson is plain hot, i just wish they had used her more in the action sequences. all in all, i had a hell of a time watching this and i would go and see it again soon and i will buy it on dvd. people, enjoy it for what it is.	0
having read some of the other comments here i was expecting something truly awful but was pleasantly surprised. reality check: the original series wasn't that good. i think some people remember it with more affection than it deserved but apart from the car chases and daisy duke's legs the scripts were weak and poorly acted. the duke boys were too intelligent and posh for backwood hicks, the shrunken boss hog was too cretinous to be evil and rosco was just hyper throughout every screen moment. it's amazing the series actually lasted as long as it did because it ran out of story lines during the first series.<br /><br />back to the movie. if you watch this film in it's own right, not as a direct comparison to however you remember the tv series, then it's not bad at all. the real star is of course the general lee. the car chases and stunts are excellent and that's really what d.o.h. is all about. johnny knoxville is his usual eccentric self and along with seann william scott as cousin bo the pair make this film really funny in a hilarious dumb-and-dumber sort of way the tv series never achieved. the lovely jessica simpson is a natch as miss daisy, burt reynolds makes a much improved boss hog and m.c. gainey makes a believably nasty rosco p. coltrane, the way he always should have been.<br /><br />if you don't like slapstick humour and crazy car stunts then you wouldn't be watching this film anyway because you should know what to expect. otherwise if you want an entertaining car-action movie with a few good laughs that's not too taxing on the brain then go see this enjoyable romp with an open mind.	0
i'm a huge fan of the dukes of hazzard tv show. and i really enjoyed this flick. i enjoyed myself here a lot more than i did with other summer blockbusters.<br /><br />it's funny hearing people rail against this movie with excuses like ""lame plot"" and ""it's much cruder than the show."" does anyone remember the crudeness of the humor in the pilot episode? daisy makes incest jokes and bo says that luke had probably fathered half the kids in the orphanage. the only reason it was cleaned up is because it changed to and earlier time slot.<br /><br />and as far as the plot goes. it was the perfect dukes plot. in fact as a remake it probably stays truer to the source material than any tv show that has migrated to the big screen.<br /><br />while sean william scott and johnny knoxville aren't exactly like their small screen versions, they do a great job and work very well together. i wasn't too keen on burt's boss hogg though. and i would have like a little bit more incompetence from sheriff roscoe. in the movie roscoe is a little... scary.<br /><br />and who didn't have a smile on their face as the general lee is racing through the streets of atlanta and the back roads of hazzard?<br /><br />folks, allow yourself to enjoy a movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia, bikinis and car chases, you won't be sorry. it's just a great dumb movie!	0
i saw this movie when i was a child. it blew me away. this was before the days of television, so a movie of this magnitude, could send a young kid into orbit. it so impressed me, that i went to see this movie for twelve consecutive days. the special effects used at this time were far ahead of its' time. sabu was a real delight, as was rex ingram as the genie. i found myself singing ""i want to be a sailor"" for months after the film left town. i would recommend this movie to any and everyone. i forgot to mention conrad veidt, who was as villainous a character as you'd ever want to meet. also, june duprez was never lovelier than she was in this picture. the color was outstanding. give this movie an aaa!	0
loved the movie. i even liked most of the actors in it. but, for me ms. davis' very poor attempt at an accent, and her stiff acting really makes an otherwise compelling movie very hard to watch. seriously if any other modern actor played the same role with the same style as ms. davis they would be laughed off the screen.<br /><br />i really think she 'phoned this one in'. now if it had myrna loy or ingrid bergman playing the part of the wife i would have enjoyed it much more.<br /><br />i guess i just don't 'get' bette davis. i've always thought of her as an actor that 'plays herself' no matter what role she's in. the possible exception is now voyager.<br /><br />i'm sure many of the other reviewers will explain in careful (and i hope civil) detail how i am totally wrong on this. but, i'll continue to watch the movies she's in because i like the stories/writing/supporting casts, but, i'll always be thinking, of different actresses that could have done a better job.	0
next to ""star wars"" and ""the wizard of oz,"" this remains one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. it's a true shame it's not as well-known as the former films (maybe because it sticks to a story based on legends rather than contemporary or sci-fi settings, and that it's british, meaning a smaller market for films) but its wonderful to know that it's deserved that reputation.<br /><br />like all great family films, one can be a child, an adult, or even a teenager to enjoy this film (i'm currently 18), but one must appreciate classic films first. i absolutely adore this film. it has an extraordinary music score by miklos rozsa (perhaps my favorite classic film score) that rivals any john williams ""star wars"" score, a fast but not flashy pace, beautiful sets, dialog, and use of color (both the sets and cinematography won oscars), and state-of-the-art oscar-winning special effects (for the time, and some are still stunning). and, of course, june duprez's sultry looks as the princess rivals that of catherine zeta-jones' (she even looks like jones in a way!).<br /><br />in conclusion, this is one of my all-time favorite movie (next to ""the adventures of robin hood"") and it truly deserves more attention. it is a true adventure of enchantment throughout, and, along with ""robin hood,"" it's my desert island film that i could watch over and over again without getting annoyed.<br /><br />stars: **** (excellent)	0
it is very rare for a film to appeal to viewers of all ages--to children for a fine narrative and a wonderful, colorful production, and, to adults, for a literate script, fine production values, good casting/acting, all bound together with a fine rozsa score. two roughly contemporary films accomplish this--""thief of baghdad"" (1940) and ""the adventures of robin hood"" (1938). some of the back story on this production is fascinating. this production, commenced in england in the summer of 1939, moved to hollywood, and proved a cover for british intelligence efforts! the producer, alexander korda, was subsequently knighted in 1942. here is a unique case of the intersection of art, commerce, and politics! by all means, secure a good cd of this film for your library!	0
this is a beautiful movie filled with adventure. the genii in the bottle is a classic scene. romantic in it's finish, all things turn out as they should be. i saw this first as a child and have remembered it as a fantasy i wished was true.	0
let's cut a long story short. i loved every minute of it. a lavish fantasy in true arabian-nights style. there's an evil magician, a pretty princess, a djinn and everybody lives happily ever after. modern hollywoond sure does have one or two things to learn from this classic. only quibble: the special effects are pretty dated (loved sabu with the djinn's foot, though!)	0
a magical journey concocted by alexander korda and michael powell. these two titans of the british cinema have mixed some fabulous ingredients to produce a movie masterpiece! some of the most ravishing early technicolor, a sublime and shimmering miklos rozsa musical score along with the youthful exuberance of sabu, the theatrical and malevolent villainy of conrad veidt and the exquisite beauty and voice of june duprez as the princess all work wonderfully well. miles malleson who plays duprez father, the sultan of basra, also wrote the perfect screenplay which is appropriately grandiose. don't miss this one! since posting the above comments, i have obtained the recently released dvd and can honestly say i'd never seen the picture properly until viewing this dvd version-the clarity and resolution is so precise and the colors are so vivid that i was stunned-this amazing classic can be watched time an again and never fails to charm and delight the viewer. again, a must see!	0
a fantastic arabian adventure. a former king, ahmad, and his best friend, the thief abu (played by sabu of black narcissus) search for ahmad's love interest, who has been stolen by the new king, jaffar (conrad veidt). there's hardly a down moment here. it's always inventing new adventures for the heroes. personally, i found ahmad and his princess a little boring (there's no need to ask why john justin, who plays ahmad, is listed fourth in the credits). conrad veidt, always a fun actor, makes a great villain, and sabu is a lot of fun as the prince of thieves, who at one point finds a genie in a bottle. i also really loved miles malleson as the sultan of basra, the father of the princess. he collects amazing toys from around the world. jaffar bribes him for his daughter's hand with a mechanical flying horse. this probably would count as one of the great children's films of all time, but the special effects are horribly dated nowadays. kids will certainly deride the superimposed images when abu and the genie are on screen together. and the scene with the giant spider looks especially awful. although most of the younger generation probably thinks that king kong looks bad at this point in time, willis o'brien's stop-motion animation is a thousand times better than a puppet on a string that doesn't even look remotely like a spider. 8/10.	0
this was usually producer alexander korda's advice on set to many of his underlings; the film is credited with three directors but in truth alex, zoltan korda and william cameron menzies helped out, pushing it to six.<br /><br />for john kobal's 1987 book, ""the top 100 movies"", his survey of 81 film critics saw the thief of bagdad reach 55th place. a closer examination reveals only jose luis guarner, john russell taylor and kobal himself actually voted for the picture, but their high placings were enough to take it to near the half-way mark.<br /><br />the outbreak of the second world war saw the movie's production shifted around england and america, eventually seeing completion in 1940 and winning three technical oscars. like citizen kane, it is in some ways perhaps a film you might admire rather than love.<br /><br />the special effects, outstanding for the time, are still reasonable, and actually hold up if you squint. but it's not so much their effectiveness as the audacity of the inventions. among them is an amusing horse, constructed out of a kit model, which, when a key is inserted up it's rear end, begins to fly. there's also a killer toy of the six-armed goddess kali, (perhaps quite obviously a single woman with two women sitting behind her) and a quite horrific-looking giant spider. also impressing is the climax with its wonderful flying carpet. but most memorable has to be rex ingram appearing as, in a superb moment of cinematic conceit, a djinn (genie) nearly a thousand feet tall! ingram portrays the genie as quite a menacing creature, and adds an element of danger to the proceedings. and look out for the moment where he's tricked back into his bottle!<br /><br />john justin does well as the arabic king who, for some strange reason, has an english accent and a stiff upper lip. sabu, the astonishingly muscled 15year-old, is near-namesake abu, a likeably cocky thief. after they cross paths with the evil jaffer (conrad veidt), justin finds himself blind and abu is turned into a dog. when it seems the rest of the film will be told in flashback through the blind ahmed's (justin's) perspective, we find that halfway through the movie we catch up to the present and the adventure continues. in truth, the second half is someway the better, being full of greater incident and more fantastical in nature.<br /><br />three small songs pepper the piece, though as the film lasts for 100 minutes this feels more like mild flavouring rather than a real ingredient; i wouldn't classify this as a musical. it's all great fun; justin and june duprez are the love interest for the mums and dads, veidt is the boo-hiss villain, and abu is the youthful, irrepressible robber. it may take a while to get into the somewhat dated mindset and overblown melodrama of 40s english movies, but once you've sat through the first half an hour or so this film really draws you in. quite commendable.	0
the making of the thief of bagdad is quite a story unto itself, almost as wondrous as the tale told in this film. alexander korda nearly went broke making this film.<br /><br />according to the citadel film series book about the great british films, adopted son of the united kingdom alexander korda had conceived this film as early as 1933 and spent years of planning and preparation. but world war ii unfortunately caught up with korda and the mounting expenses of filming a grand spectacle.<br /><br />budget costs happen in us films too, only cecil b. demille always had a free hand at paramount after 1932 when he returned there. but demille nor any of his american contemporaries had to worry about enemy bombs while shooting the film. part of the way through the shoot, korda transported the whole company to america and shot those sequences with rex ingram as the genie in our grand canyon. he certainly wasn't going to get scenery like that in the uk. korda also finished the interiors in hollywood, all in time for a release on christmas day 1940.<br /><br />the spectacle of the thing earned the thief of bagdad four academy award nominations and three oscars for best color cinematography, best art&set direction for a color film, and best special effects. only miklos rosza's original musical score did not take home a prize in a nominated category. korda must have been real happy about deciding to shoot in the grand canyon because it's impossible to get bad color pictures from that place.<br /><br />the special effects however do not overwhelm the simple story of good triumphing over evil. the good is the two young lovers john justin and june duprez and the evil is conrad veidt as the sorcerer who tries to steal both a kingdom and a heart, both belonging to duprez. this was veidt's career role until casablanca where he played the luftwaffe major stroesser. <br /><br />of course good gets a little help from an unlikely source. beggar boy and thief sabu who may very well have been one of the few who could call himself at the time an international movie star. literally rising from poverty working as an elephant stable boy for the maharajah of mysore he was spotted by alexander korda who needed a native lead for one of his jungle features. sabu captures all the innocence and mischievousness of youth as he fulfills the arabian nights fantasy of the boy who topples a tyrant. not a bad message to be sending out in 1940 at that.<br /><br />the thief of bagdad holds up remarkably well today. it's an eternal tale of love, romance, and adventure in any order you want to put it.	0
this was a favorite of my childhood - i can remember seeing it on television and thrilling to it each time. now that i'm grown up and have a kid of my own, i wanted to introduce him to this classic movie. we watched it last friday, and he liked it. during abu's fight with the giant spider, my son's hand crept over and took hold of mine - he was genuinely scared. ""is he gonna beat the spider, poppa?"" just watch, you'll see. he has no historical frame of reference to speak of (eight years old), so bagdad under the grandson of haroun al-raschid might as well be oz under ozma.<br /><br />i think he especially liked how much of the heroics and derring-do were perpetrated by the boy-thief, and not the grown-up king. in fact, if you deconstruct the film's narrative a bit, the king is the thief's sidekick, not the hero at all - which must be very satisfying to imaginative, adventurous young boys. <br /><br />it's definitely a period piece - i suspect that by the time he's eleven or twelve, my son will find it 'corny' or whatever word the next generation will be using by then. the love story is barely one-dimensional - as a cynical friend commented, ""why does ahmad love the princess? because the narrative demands it."" the willingness of abu to put himself in jeopardy (repeatedly) for the clueless, love-struck deposed king is equally improbable. but to quibble about such things while accepting flying mechanical horses, fifty-foot genies and the temple of the all-seeing eye would be fatuous in the extreme. the satisfaction of seeing the prophecy fulfilled at the movie's climax is tremendous, as is the final shot of abu triumphantly flying away on his (stolen) magic carpet, seeking ""some fun, and adventure at last!"	0
"i have seen this film several times, and watched it today (on tcm) solely because of geraldine fitzgerald. she is a much underrated actress and i have to admit i have had a crush on her since i first saw her (probably in ""wuthering heights"" 40 or more years ago). the real star in this movie, however, is paul lukas, and he deserved all the accolades he got. he makes it clear, whether we like it or not, that the end justifies the means. naziism had to be stopped, and anything that helped do it was good. he gave his children a line about being bad, and that they should not be bad, but as he said earlier when conversing with adults, he would do this sort of thing again without hesitation. lukas did give an excellent portrayal of a man caught in this situation, and made it clear that what he did was a very hard thing to do.<br /><br />some people think his victim was a nazi, but i don't think so - i think he was only after the money. his nazi associates knew this and that is why they did not have much use for him.<br /><br />one interesting point in the film, and presumably also in the play, is the fact that muller (lucas) is a german. while the anti german hysteria of wwi was not repeated in wwii, there was considerable anti-german sentiment and some germans were interred similar to what happened in california with people of japanese ancestry. it was something of an act of bravery for hellman to write a play about good germans at this time (maybe she thought they were the ones who signed the nazi-soviet pact!). after all, the us and british air forces were bombing german cities and having no qualms about killing innocent civilians. i think, however, that the dresden bombing and firestorm happened later, after ""watch on the rhine"" was released.<br /><br />the title is something of a play on words, as the ""watch"" is looking west, from germany. in fact, watch am rhein was a german army marching song - used in wwii, but the nazis had their own marching song that was used as well. but muller is a german and he is engaged in his own ""wach am rhein"".<br /><br />all the other actors did an excellent job here; although bodo was too much there are children like him. i am surprised he did not give his father's secret away. in real life, he may very well have done so."	0
when i read other comment,i decided to watch this movie...<br /><br />first, cast specially michael madsen and tamer karadagli; good enough...<br /><br />film,very intelligence and interesting because ,cast have a lot of international specially european actor and actress like from turkey and russsia...<br /><br />second,story is basic and you can guess but if you interesting action good play you'll like in my opinion...<br /><br />third,final chapter is not special or interesting,it's regular like other action movies...<br /><br />finally,i recommend to watch this movie...and i hope you'll love it enjoy :d	0
"probably the finest fantasy film ever made. sumptuous colour, spectacular sets, incredible, spot-on miklos rosza musical score that is perfect for each scene and mood. acting is superb as well in what could have been stiff and pretentious in lesser hands, but here the poetic dialog is deftly, sensitively spoken (the humour is subtle and delightful as well).<br /><br />doubtless spielberg and lucas were enthralled by this one. along with ""the four feathers"" (1939), one of the two finest motion pictures released by alexander korda and london films---and one of the finest motion pictures ever made.<br /><br />a true, compelling classic!"	0
"words can hardly describe it, so i'll be brief. ""the thief of bagdad"" was my favorite movie as a child, and it has never ceased to astound or enchant me. i loved this film from the first moment i saw it, when i was a boy of six who had started reading ""the arabian nights."" i remember walking into the tv room in the middle of sabu's battle with the giant spider and being instantly beguiled.<br /><br />rarely has so much beauty, magic, and wonder been captured on film. sabu and john justin are superb as the dashing heros, conrad veidt is throughly delightful as the wicked villain jaffar, and rex ingram is a joy to watch as the sardonic genie. georges perinal's photography is some of the best use of technicolor. one of the three credited directors is michael powell, a filmmaker who has been rightfully heralded by the critics but is often overlooked by audiences for his remarkable films, including ""a matter of life and death"" (aka ""stairway to heaven"") and ""the red shoes."" he is one of the true masters of the camera, right up there with david lean, akira kurosawa, and orson welles.<br /><br />as with all great works of art, the beauty of ""the thief of bagdad"" lies in the detail. every frame has its own magical charm. the story never lags, and the characters and their actions are always involving. here is a film that will never grow old."	0
i first saw thief as a child which makes me almost as old as the jinn i guess. as any kid would be, i was delighted with the imagination, inventiveness and energy of the film. several years later, i realized how much of the satire and wit of the script i had missed on that first viewing. i have never passed up an opportunity to watch it throughout the intervening years. in addition to the script, the production transcends the fantasy genre. this is korda, the storyteller at his very best. when you see thief as a child you know that you`ve had a great time. when you see thief as an adult you know that you`ve seen a masterpiece. it`s as timeless as the story it treats. an amazing work.<br /><br />thomas mccarthy	0
this is an oriental fantasy about ¨thousand and one arabian nights¨ plenty of incredible adventures, fantasy witchery and wizardly. the malignant vizier jaffar (magnificently played by conrad veidt)with powerful magic faculties imprisons the prince ahamad of bagdad(attractive john justin)who loses his throne, then he escapes thanks a little thief named abu(sympathetic sabu). they arrive basora where ahamad and the princess(gorgeous june duprez) fall in love. but prince and thief are haunted by jaffar , ahamd is turned blind and abu is become a dog. the story accumulates several fantastic ingredients such as transformation of the starring, a flying mechanic horse, magic bow, flying carpet and of course the colossal genie(overacting performed by rex ingram) who gives three wishes to sabu , the magic eye, the figure of goddess kali with several hands, among others.<br /><br />this remarkable picture ranks as one of the finest fantastic films of all time. produced by london fim's alexander korda and directed by the definitively credited ludwing berger, michael powell and tim whelan with a stunning screenplay by lajos biro and miles malleson also dialogs writer and actor as sultan fond to mechanic games. the wwii outbreak caused the paralyzing shooting, then the three korda brothers and collaborators traveled usa continuing there the filming in especial on grand cannon colorado.the splendid visual and glimmer technicolor cinematography , setting and fx provoked the achieving three oscars : production design by william cameron menzies and vincent korda ,cinematography by george perinal and special effects by osmond borradaile though today are dated and is urgent a necessary remastering because the colors are worn-out. furthermore one nomination for the evocative and oriental musical score by miklos rozsa. this vivid tale with immense doses of imagination will like to fantasy fans and cinema classic buffs	0
"despite having 6 different directors, this fantasy hangs together remarkably well.<br /><br />it was filmed in england (nowhere near morocco) in studios and on a few beaches. at the outbreak of war, everything was moved to america and some scenes were filmed in the grand canyon.<br /><br />notable for having one of the corniest lyrics in a song - ""i want to be a bandit, can't you understand it"". it remains a favourite of many people."	0
this film, was one of my childhood favorites and i must say that, unlike some other films i liked in that period the thief of bagdad has held on to it's quality while i grew up. this is not merely a film to be enjoyed by children, it can be watched and enjoyed by adults as well. the only drawback there is, is that one can not see past the bad' effects (compared to the effects nowadays) like one could when one was a child. i remembered nothing of those effects, of course it had been about ten years since i'd seen this film, when i was about eleven years old. who then watches effects? one only seeks good stories and entertainment and this is exactly what this film provides. in my mind this film is one of the first great adventure films of the 20th century. coming to think of it i feel like the indiana jones films are quite a like this film. there is comedy, romance and adventure all in one, which creates a wonderful mixture that will capture you from the beginning until the end and although the film is old and the music and style of the films is clearly not modern, it succeeds in not being dusty and old. all of that is mainly due to the great story, the good directing and the good acting performances of the actors. in that department sabu (as abu) and conrad veidt (as jaffar) stand out, providing the comedic and the chilling elements of the film for the most part. great film and although an 'oldie', definitely a goldie'. i hope someone has the brain and guts to release this one on dvd someday.<br /><br />8 out of 10	0
abu, the thief of bagdad, helps king ahmed regain his kingdom from a wicked sorcerer.<br /><br />as europe was going to war and significant sections of the world was going up in flames, sir alexander korda's london films unveiled this lavish escapist fare from the legends of the arabian nights. replete with swords & sorcery, it gave audiences in 1940 a short respite from the headlines. it also is a fine piece of film making, featuring good acting and an intelligent script.<br /><br />conrad veidt gets top billing and he deserves it, playing the evil magician jaffar. his saturnine face with its piercing eyes makes one recall the macabre roles he played with such relish during silent days. here is a villain worth watching. as the boyish thief, sabu is perfectly cast in this, his third film. while not a hero in the typical sense of the word, his character is certainly heroic in deed & action.<br /><br />the rest of the cast do fine work. john justin is both energetic & sensitive as the unenlightened king who must learn about the realities of live the hard way; sabu gets a significant part of the action (when he's not transformed into a dog) but justin is appropriately athletic when needs must. lovely june duprez plays the endangered princess of basra, coveted by two very different men. appearing late in the film, massive rex ingram shakes things up as a genie with an attitude.<br /><br />allan jeayes uses his fine voice to good advantage as the storyteller. miles malleson gets another eccentric role as the childlike sultan of basra, forever dithering on about his mechanical toys (malleson was also responsible for the film's screen play & dialogue). aged morton selten portrays the benevolent king of legend. mary morris, later an exceptional stage actress, plays the dual roles of jaffar's accomplice and the six-armed silver dancer.<br /><br />the film was begun in britain, but wartime difficulties made korda move it to southern california, which probably explains the presence of american ingram in the cast. the art direction, in vibrant technicolor, is most attractive, especially the fairy tale architecture in blues, whites & pinks.<br /><br />*************************<br /><br />born sabu dastagir in 1924, sabu was employed in the maharaja of mysore's stables when he was discovered by korda's company and set before the cameras. his first four films (elephant boy-1937, the drum-1938, the thief of bagdad-1940, jungle book-1942) were his best and he found himself working out of hollywood when they were completed. after distinguished military service in world war ii he resumed his film career, but he became endlessly confined for years playing ethnic roles in undistinguished minor films, black narcissus (1947) being the one great exception. his final movie, walt disney's a tiger walks (1964) was an improvement, but it was too late. sabu had died of a heart attack in late 1963, only 39 years of age.	0
"the story-line of ""the thief of bagdad"" is complex, owing to its being told in flashbacks and having three separate and equally important strands woven together. the screenplay by lajo biros and the dialogue by miles malleson keep the story moving skillfully at all points.the young king ahmad of bagdad is angry at his vizier jaffar for executing a man for having different ideas. he discovers while in disguise that people blame him for jaffar's deeds and hate him. he is imprisoned by jaffar, where he meets abu the young thief. the two escape and take a boat to the city of basra. there the companions spy when men clear the way so none will see the princess of the city passing by. ahmad falls in love with her and visits her in her garden. he tells her he has come to her from beyond time and wins a kiss. then he is captured. when jaffar comes to win the princess of basra for himself, ahmad attacks the evil vizier who blinds him and turns abu into a dog. jaffar then asks for the princess's hand, and he gives the gift of a mechanical flying horse to the sultan of basra. the blind ahmad then tells his tale in the marketplace, accompanied by abu as his dog. the prince has fallen into a sleep and nothing can wake her. so jaffar sends his servant halima for ahmad and the dog, in hopes the prince can rouse her. he does awaken her. she boards a ship to find a doctor to cure ahmad, but she is captured by jaffar who then throws the dog overboard. she then allows jaffar to take her in his arms, on his promise to restore ahmad's sight and turn abu back into a thief. the princess sees a vision of ahmad; he is in a boat; jaffar sends a storm to beset him and abu is shipwrecked on a deserted island. abu finds a genie or djinn who wants to kill him now that he is free after many centuries spent imprisoned in a bottle. abu tricks him into proving he really came from so small a vessel, then corks him in again. for freeing him, he gets three wishes. his first is for sausages. in the meanwhile, the princess pleads with her father to refuse jaffar; but jaffar shows the sultan a new mechanical toy, one of whose six arms stabs him to death. abu makes a second wish, to find ahmad. the cunning genie flies him to the goddess of the all-seeing eye. abu has to climb a great web to get to the gem that is the eye, battling a giant spider, then scaling the goddess's statue. abu gazes into the 'eye' and sees ahmad in a canyon. he has the genie take him to ahmad. ahmad uses the eye to see the princess. she smells a flower and forgets everything at once. abu wishes they were in bagdad, but the genie laughs and leaves; jaffar tells the princess that she is in love with him, omitting mention of ahmad. ahmad tries to fight his way to the princess, but jaffar smashes the 'eye'. abu finds himself in the ""land of legend"", where the old men who rule want to make him their king. he steals a bow and a magic carpet and escapes instead, to hurry to save ahmad and the princess. the thief arrives in time to save the young king from the executioner, using his bow from the flying carpet, to the wonder of the throng who had come to watch the execution. jaffar tries to flee on the mechanical flying horse, but another shot from the bow finishes him. ahmad is ruler again and plans to wed his princess; but when he tries to make abu his vizier, the young thief refuses, saying that what he wants is adventure, not hard work and confinement in a palace however grand it may be. this fantastic story was given a sumptuous production by producer alexander korda. the production was designed by vincent korda who was also art director, while georges perinal did the colorful cinematography. the directors credited are ludwig berger and michael powell, with tim whelan, alexander korda, william cameron menzies and zoltan korda participating. the extraordinary and numerous costumes designs were the work of john armstrong, oliver messel and marcel vertes. the production, apart from its gorgeous and expensive-looking visual splendors, i claim is dominated by two other elements, the choral music of miklos rozsa and the performance by conrad veidt as the evil jaffar. rex ingram plays the genie with a curious accent, plus his usual intelligence and power. june duprez is lovely and effective as the princess mary morris is a sad and beautiful halima, and miles malleson a properly bumbling and avaricious sultan. as ahmad, john justin appears to do most of what can be done with the part of a young prince in love and then some; he is memorably good in his winning role. this film has a spaciousness about it that is found, i assert, in other korda works also. its imaginative content stands in contrast to very-strong realistic sets, costumes and set-design elements. this is one of the most memorable idea-level fantasies of all time, worthy to be enjoyed over and over."	0
"i first saw this movie when i was a little kid and fell in love with it at once. the sets are breath taking and some of the script is damn right hilarious: ""you sons of a thousand fleas"".<br /><br />it is always shown on tv late at night or really early in the morning i woke up at about 3:00 am once and it had just started. tv companys need to show a little more respect and put it on prime time sunday so everyone can get a chance to view this fine work.<br /><br />10/10"	0
"-the movie tells the tale of a prince whose life is wonderful, but after an evil wizard tells him to go into town disguised as a beggar the wizard then locks up the prince and soon becomes the shadow ruler of baghdad. the jailed prince meets a thief called abu who helps him escape the jail and head to a town called basra where he meets a princess who he falls madly in love with, but unbeknown to him the evil wizard jafa is also in love with the princess and tries to convince her father to allow him to marry her. jafa soon learns that the prince is trying to win the girls heart so he makes him blind and turns abu into a dog. this leads to the prince and abu going off on an adventure to find a way to defeat jafa, restore peace to baghdad and marry the princess. during their journey they encounter everything from sarcastic genies that takes abu on a flight through the clouds, a giant spider that's really hungry, and a flying horse that probably gives birth to one of the most beautiful sequence these old eyes of mine have ever seen.<br /><br />-this is a pure fantasy movie from start to finish it has flying horses, genies, flying carpets, and wizards that can actually do magic instead of just hit people with their staffs. it doesn't have any cheesy moments and the love story isn't a waste of time. the production designs are just stunning in this movie. from the palaces to the different dangerous traps that the heroes encounter. even though this movie is over 40 years old, the production design is far better than most of the crap that gets tacked on in today's cinema. the music and songs are also well done. anyone who sees it will no doubt hail, ""i want to be a sailor sailing on the seas"" as one of the great musical moments in movies. i'm usually not a huge fan of singing in movies since i find them about as enjoyable as doing my taxes but i'll be more than happy to make an exception for this movie.<br /><br />-what sells the movie for me is the sheer fact that you get to see things you don't see in everyday life which is also the same reason why i love stuff like ""two towers"" and ""silent hill"". way before today's modern fantasy movie came along with their realistic cgi to blow our minds there was this movie which blew your mind without having green screen scattered all over the place. one of my favorite shots in ""two towers"" is the one where we see the trolls opening the black gates, the main appeal of that shot for me was seeing these great fantasy beings doing what is essentially manual labor, and that's what i love about the genie and other creatures in the movie. they're just there trying to make a living just like everyone else which gives them a real feel even though they're all just fantasy beings.<br /><br />-it's literally impossible to watch this movie and not notice where the makers of ""aladdin"" got their inspiration. the characters from this movie are pretty much the same characters in that movie from the talkative genie right down to the flying carpet. it's not an entirely bad thing in my eyes since it's nice to know that i'm not the only one on the planet that has a deep passionate love for this amazing movie. i first saw this as a kid in the motherland and thought it was the greatest thing in the world and upon watching it again last week i still think it's amazing. that's a true testament that a great movie can withstand the test of time. sure, the effects look a wee bit outdated and cheesy but it was made way back in the 40's so give it a break. not everything looks outdated though since most of the stuff can still hold its own today when scrutinized under today's standard.<br /><br />-if you ever wanted to see a live action version of ""aladdin"" then you should get your wish with this but the angry cynical bunch will probably do good in avoiding this since this won't be their cup of tea."	0
outstanding film of 1943 with paul lukas giving an oscar calibrated performance as the head of his family bringing them back to america from europe as the nazi menace deepened.<br /><br />the usual terrific bette davis maintains her reputation here and for a change was not nominated for best actress for this or any film of 1943.<br /><br />encounting treachery around them, lukas successfully deals with the situation. he knows he must return to europe on a clandestine mission and return he does.<br /><br />davis again pulls out all the stops with a katharine hepburn-like shedding of tears when they must part. resolute, she knows that her older son, must follow him on his path to liberty.<br /><br />a wonderful film highlighting american positive propaganda against a wicked foe.	0
"the thief of baghdad is one of my ten all-time favorite movies. it is exciting without gore, it is beautifully filmed and the art direction is flawless. the casting couldn't have been better. rex ingram made me believe in genies. and the epitome of evil is certainly captured by conrad veight as jafar. he set the bar very high.<br /><br />..i watch this movie at least twice a year...and never tire of it. this film is an adventure for all ages..no-one too old to enjoy it. the thief of bahgdad jogs my memories to a more innocent time...i was ten years old the first time i saw it and the u.s. was just about to enter wwii. conrad vieght was such a great actor that he was able to continue this underlying ""evilness"" a few years later in ""casablanca."" and korda teamed up,i believe, with justin and dupree again in ""the four feathers""....great film-making!"	0
an utterly beautiful film, one of a handful of i saw when young that entranced me then and still do, in thief's case the impression actually seems to get better with the passing of time. by the '90's my daughter and i had seen it many times on tv but still went to the pictures when it came to the local art-house cinema  when it had finished we came out starry eyed with heads full of poetry and miklos rozsa's stirring music wishing it could have lasted a couple of hours longer and thinking what a beautiful world it suddenly was again.<br /><br />idealistic prince ahmad wants to slum it amongst his people for a while to check things out, but evil vizier jaffar takes his chance to imprison him and seize the throne. after escaping with a little thief played by sabu, ahmad spots a princess and they fall blindingly in love  along the way they have many adventures (although apparently not enough for sabu!) and love not only conquers but annihilates everything. the special effects must have been mesmerising in 1940, but time has taken its toll and lessened their impact especially since digital cartoonery has taken over even live action  but they still hold up well compared against films like superman from 40 years later. anyway, if i'm requested to suspend disbelief in gargantuan guffawing genies, flying horses and carpets i also suspend disbelief in perfect special effects! favourite bits: the dreamy scene in the sunlit garden when ahmad reveals himself and adelaide hall's suitably romantic song; the stunning colours in the tent in the land of legend  in fact, the stunning colours throughout; sabu and rozsa's triumphant but still wistful finale. conrad veidt played the baddie in two of the most incredible movie romances ever, this and casablanca, and then died. john justin and june duprez were great in the leading roles of lovers, both of them slightly and refreshingly stilted, but the parts didn't call for a huge range of emotions: only pure love mattered.<br /><br />there's a couple of mildly violent images in it, but rest assured this is a glorious feelgood experience with a 100% positive message, it's only a pity that nowadays little kids don't watch this instead of the porn they prefer. one of my top 10 film favourites, i can't recommend this too much  may it be shown to the end of time.	0
"the thief of bagdad is a treasure. first and foremost, it is a good story. though my four children's primary exposure to this tale, the most famous of the stories of the arabian nights, comes from the disney corporation, the thief of bagdad held their interest to the end. the story moves along at a good pace and includes a twist or two that reduced predictability. sabu, who plays the young thief, abu, also measures up to any of today's teen actors in appeal, judging from the number of times i heard my oldest daughter say, ""he's c-u-t-e!"" <br /><br />in 1940, the film won oscars for cinematography and special effects. today, of course, those effects seem very dated (""look, it's barbie flying through the air,"" declared my daughter at the sight of the genie flying). yet they fit into the story well. the film is, after all, over 60 years old. the effects fit with the script. furthermore, what ones sees in the thief of bagdad remained pretty much state-of-the-art for the next twenty-five years. one need only compare the opening montage from a 1967 star trek episode to see this. in that, it was quite an achievement.<br /><br />this qualifies as a family film, though there are a few stabbings near the end. the acting is so obvious and the wounds so bloodless as to those scenes nearly as artificial as animation.<br /><br />all in all, a fun film worth watching for either an evening of pure entertainment, or for the historical value of the effects. i recommend it."	0
i grew up with this as my all-time favorite film. the special effects are incredible for the era, and won awards. i can remember the dialogue as if i'd heard it yesterday. it is simply a great, timeless adventure. the music is by miklos rosza, who is cinema history's best. sabu is the thief. conrad veidt is the grand villain. i have a copy within reach, for the next trip down memory lane. whoa there! rex ingram wants out of his genii bottle!	0
three flash-backs introduce the main characters (abu, jaffar, and the princess) who will interact with ahmad; three are the songs, each linked to those same characters. three times does ahmad pronounce the absolute word 'time', in his declaration of love to the princess, answering her three questions at their first of three meetings. so strong is the impression he causes, that the princess will resist the three attempts by jaffar to conquer her - by three successive ploys: deceit, hypnosis, and memory erasing. yet, jaffar owns what he describes as the three inescapable instruments of domination over a woman: the whip, the power, and the sword. three is the number of flying entities: the mechanical-horse, the genie, and the the genie and the magic carpet. the genie offers three wishes to abu at their first of three encounters; three times does the genie laugh loud in the mountain gorges, and three are his considerations about human frailty, before he departs. abu overcomes three obstacles in the temple of dawn (armed guards, giant-spider, and giant-octopus). three are the instruments of justice: the magical eye that shows abu the future, the magical carpet that transports him just in time to save ahmad and the princess, and the bow-and-arrow to execute jaffar. there's magic in the number three, and there is magic in this movie.	0
like the arabian nights this film plays with storytelling conventions in order to make us feel that there's plot, plot and more plot: it opens with what appears to be the frame device of a blind man telling the story of his life, then plunges into a flashback which takes us right up to the blind man's present, where we discover that about half of the story is yet to come. (it must be admitted that the second half doesn't quite live up to the promise of the first.) like the arabian nights it tries to cram as many middle-eastern folk motiffs as possible into the one work. a freed genie, a beautiful princess, a flying carpet, fantastic mechanical toys, sea voyages, a crowded marketplace, a wicked vizier, jewels ... i don't know why it all works, but it does. everything is just so beautiful. the sets are beautiful. june duprez is beautiful. rozsa's score is especially beautiful. as usual, it sounds hungarian; but somehow he manages to convince us that he's being hungarian in a persian way.	0
"the thief of bagdad"" is impressive in the shape of the evil magician jaffar (conrad veidt). he plots with lies and magic spells to obtain the kingdom from its rightful ruler the young king ahmad, and a gorgeous princess from her father...<br /><br />he falls victim in the end, as all tyrants do (in books and legends) to love and of the common man whom he ignored, here embodied by the little thief (sabu).<br /><br />the armies of good and evil, black and white, are superbly realized in both visual and literary terms...<br /><br />the script is poetic, simply and very beautiful... the costumes of the magician and his men rising and falling like the wings of black birds, attacking suddenly in the night to inflict destruction and create terror...<br /><br />the radiant hero wears white turbans and robes, and his princess is dressed in pinks and pale blues...<br /><br />for spectacular scenes it matched all that had gone before, while through its use of color, it brought to life a world such as had not seemed possible before...<br /><br />with flying carpet and flying white horse, with a giant genie (excellently played by rex ingram), with evil wizards, and with the good acting of sabu and veidt, ""the thief of bagdad"" captures the quality and true atmosphere of the arabian nights... <br /><br />the 1940 version remains the screen's finest fairy tale!	0
the story of the boy thief of bagdad (as it was once spelled) has attracted filmmakers from raoul walsh in 1924, who starred douglas fairbanks in the first, silent, rendering of ""thief of bagdad,"" to less imposing, more recent attempts. the best, however, remains 1940's version which for its time was a startling, magical panoply of top quality special effects. those effects still work their charm.<br /><br />no less than six directors are listed for the technicolor movie which starred sabu as the boy thief, abu, john justin as the dreamily in love deposed monarch, ahmad and june duprez as the lovely princess sought by ahmad and pursued by the evil vizier, jaffar, played by a sinister conrad veidt. the giant genie is ably acted by rex ingram.<br /><br />ahmad is treacherously deposed by jaffar and when later arrested by that traitorous serpent, he and the boy, abu, suffer what are clearly incapacitating fates. ahmad is rendered blind and abu becomes a lovable mutt. their adventures through the gaily decorated hollywood backlots are fun but the special effects make this film work.<br /><br />two men were responsible for everything from a magic flying carpet to the gargantuan genie who pops out of a bottle with a tornado-like black swirl: lawrence w. butler and tom howard. (howard, incidentally, did the special effects for the 1961 version of this film. both men had long and distinguished careers in technical wizardry.)<br /><br />duprez is outstandingly lovely while little called on for serious acting. justin's ahmad projects a driven but dreamy romanticism untouched by erotic impulses. sabu is really the central actor in many scenes and he's very good. for a movie meant for kids as well as adults there's a fair amount of violence but of the bloodless kind. still, i don't think anyone under eight ought to see ""thief of bagdad.""<br /><br />this film makes periodic appearances on tv but today my teenage son and i saw it in a theater with quite a few youngsters present. it was great to see computer-besotted kids in an affluent community respond with cheers and applause to special effects that must seem primitive to them.<br /><br />""thief of bagdad"" is a pre-war hollywood classic from a time when strong production values often resulted in enduringly attractive and important releases. this is one of the best of its kind.<br /><br />9/10.	0
i have to agree with mr. caruso jr lanza,s was the finest voice god had to offer if only he could have found the courage to go for broke leave hollywood and head for the opera he could have been the american caruso everyone says he could have been but in any case he is a fantastic introduction to the art form no bones about it and if thats the way its gonna be so be it. see the film you'll see why mr lanza still come up in discussion even in my house. someone says pavarotti i say mario lanza.as for the film itself when will it be on dvd they must have it restored and vhs isn't good enough but this should also be the only lanza film put on dvd the others are down right bad and boring .	0
watch on the rhine started as a broadway play by lillian hellman who wrote the film and saw it open on broadway at a time when the soviet union was still bound to nazi germany by that infamous non-aggression pact signed in august of 1939. so much for the fact that hellman was merely echoing the communist party line, the line didn't change until a couple of months later. lillian was actually months ahead of her time with this work.<br /><br />the play watch on the rhine ran from april 1941 to february 1942 for 378 performances and five players came over from broadway to repeat their roles frank wilson as the butler, eric roberts as the youngest son, lucile watson as the family matriarch and most importantly villain george coulouris and paul lukas.<br /><br />lukas pulled an award hat trick in 1943 winning an oscar, a golden globe, and the new york film critics for best actor. probably if the tony awards had been in existence then he would have won that as well. the oscar is even more remarkable when you consider who he was up against, humphrey bogart for casablanca, gary cooper in for whom the bell tolls, mickey rooney in the human comedy, and walter pidgeon for madame curie. every one of his competitors was a bigger box office movie name than he was. lukas's nomination is usually the kind the academy gives to round out a field.<br /><br />jack warner knew that which is why mady christians did not repeat her broadway part and the role of lukas's wife was given to bette davis. davis took the part not because this was an especially showy role for her, but because she believed in the picture and just wanted to be associated with it. it's the same reason she did the man who came to dinner, a much lighter play than this one.<br /><br />davis is the daughter of a late american supreme court justice who married a german national back in the weimar days. after many years of being vagabonds on the continent of europe, davis lukas, and their three children come to america which has not yet entered the european war. they're made welcome by lucile watson who is thrilled naturally at finally meeting her grandchildren.<br /><br />the fly in this ointment are some other house guests, a friend of davis's from bygone days geraldine fitzgerald and her husband who is also from europe, a rumanian diplomat and aristocrat george coulouris. coulouris is a wastrel and a spendthrift and he smells an opportunity for double dealing when he suspects lukas's anti-fascist background. <br /><br />his suspicions are quite correct, it's the reason that the family has been the vagabonds they've become. lukas fought in spain on the republican side and was wounded there. his health has not been the same since. his family loyally supports him in whatever decision he makes. those decisions affect all the other members of the cast.<br /><br />adding quite a bit more to the broadway play including some lovely fascist creatures was dashiell hammett who was lillian hellman's significant other. coulouris playing cards at the german embassy was a hammett creation with such loathsome types as henry daniell, kurt katch, clyde fillmore, erwin kalser and rudolph anders.<br /><br />coulouris is truly one of the most despicable characters ever brought to screen as the no account runmanian count. he was a metaphor for his own country who embraced the nazis with gusto and then equally repudiated them without losing a step after stalingrad.<br /><br />lucile watson was up for best supporting actress in 1943, but lost to katina paxinou in for whom the bell tolls. dashiell hammett was nominated for best adapted screenplay and the film itself lost for best picture to that other anti-fascist classic, casablanca. <br /><br />though it's an item firmly planted in those specific times, watch on the rhine still packs a stern anti-fascist message that bears repeating infinitely.	0
the great caruso displays the unique talents of mario lanza. he shows great acting capacity and is in top form as a lyrical singer, paired with dorothy kirsten, soprano of the metropolitan opera. indeed, i dare to say that he performs some songs better than caruso (check a'vuchella from tosti and la danza from rossini). the mgm art and music departments also did a good job. this movie could be perfect, were it not for the awkward presence of ann blyth; we see that she is trying her best, dressed in the fifties style in scenes just before 1920 - unforgivable. lanza deserved a better leading lady, and blyth should stick to less demanding productions. also notice that ms. kirsten sings most of the opera duets of the film with lanza, giving the wrong notion that caruso had a kind of permanent leading soprano.	0
this is a most handsome film. the color photography is beautiful as it shows the lavishness of the metropolitan opera house in brilliant color. other indoor scenes at various mansions, etc are equally brilliant. as for the music, what more can be said other than that lanza's voice was at its' peak as he sang so many of the worlds' best known and beloved arias. the marvelous dorothy kirsten is also a joy as her soprano voice blends with that of lanza in delightful harmony. of course, hollywood took their customary liberties with the life story of caruso. there is precious little in the story line that relates to actual events. for example, the facts relating to his death are totally fabricated and bear no relationship to the truth. there are some very good web sites that tell the true story of caruso and contain several pictures of him. these web sites can be located by using any good search engine. there are also several books available concerning his life history. but, the fictional story line does nothing to mar this beautiful film. the voices of lanza, kirsten, and the chorus members are the real stars of this movie. enjoy, i know that i sure did.	0
mario lanza, of course, is ""the great caruso"" in this 1951 film also starring ann blyth, dorothy kirsten, eduard franz and ludwig donath. this is a highly fictionalized biography of the legendary, world-renowned tenor whose name is known even today.<br /><br />the film is opulently produced, and the music is glorious and beautifully sung by lanza, kirsten, judmila novotna, blanche thebom, and other opera stars who appeared in the film. if you're a purist, seeing people on stage smiling during the sextet from ""lucia"" will strike you as odd - even if caruso's wife dorothy just had a baby girl. also it's highly unlikely that caruso ever sang edgardo in lucia; the role lay too high for him.<br /><br />in taking dramatic license, the script leaves out some very dramatic parts of caruso's life. what was so remarkable about him is that he actually created roles in operas that are today in the standard repertoire, yet this is never mentioned in the film. these roles include maurizio in adriana lecouvreur and dick johnson in ""girl of the golden west,"" there is a famous photo of him posing with a sheet wrapped around him like a toga. the reason for that photo? his only shirt was in the laundry. he was one of the pioneers of recorded music and had a long partnership with the victor talking-machine company (later rca victor). he was singing jose in carmen in san francisco the night of the earthquake.<br /><br />instead, the mgm story basically has him dying on stage during a performance of martha, which never happened. he had a hemorrhage during ""l'elisir d'amore"" at the met and could not finish the performance; he only sang three more times at the met, his last role as eleazar in la juive. what killed him? the same thing that killed valentino - peritonitis. his first role at the met was not radames in aida, as indicated in the film, but the duke in rigoletto. so when it says on the screen ""suggested by dorothy caruso's biography of her husband,"" that's what it was - suggested. what is true is that dorothy's father disowned her after her marriage, and left her $1 of his massive estate. they also did have a daughter gloria together (who died at the age of 79 on 10/7/2007). however, caruso had four other children by a mistress before he married dorothy.<br /><br />some people say that lanza's voice is remarkably like caruso's, but just listen to caruso sing in the film ""match point"" -- caruso's voice is remarkably unlike lanza's. in fact, from his sound, had he wanted to, caruso could have sung as a baritone. he is thought to have had some trouble with high notes, further evidence of baritone leanings; and the role he was preparing when he died was othello, a dramatic tenor role, which lanza definitely was not. lanza's voice deserved not to be compared with another. he made a unique contribution to film history, popularizing operatic music. he sings the music in ""the great caruso"" with a robust energy; he is truly here at the peak of what would be a short career. his acting is natural and genuine. ann blyth is lovely as dorothy and gets to sing a little herself.<br /><br />really a film for opera lovers and lanza fans, which are probably one and the same.	0
yes, be my love was mario lanza's skyrocket to fame and still is popular today. his voice was strong and steady, so powerful in fact that mgm decided to use him in the great caruso. lanza himself thought he was the reincarnation of caruso. having read the book by kostelanitz who wrote a biography of lanza, he explains that the constant practise and vocal lessons became the visionary caruso to lanza. there is no doubt that lanza did a superb job in the story, but the story is not entirely true; blame it on hollywood! i used to practise singing his songs years ago, and became pretty good myself until i lost my voice because of emphysema/asthma ten years ago. reaching the high note of be my love is not easy; but beautiful!	0
since musicals have both gone out of fashion and are incredibly expensive to make without all the talent needed to make one under contract to a studio, i doubt we will ever get a real life story of enrico caruso. <br /><br />but if everything else was in place it was no accident that no hollywood studio attempted the task until metro-goldwyn-mayer had mario lanza under contract. no one else could have done it, i doubt whether it will ever be tried again.<br /><br />and why should it. i think enrico caruso himself would have been satisfied as to how his singing was portrayed on screen. for his tenor voice was his life, his reason for being on the earth. <br /><br />to say that liberties were taken with his life is to be modest. caruso, like the man who portrayed him, was a man of large appetites although with a lot more self discipline. he had numerous relationships with several women and fathered two out of wedlock sons who are not in this film. <br /><br />his contribution to the recording industry is treated as almost an afterthought. he's shown in a recording studio once late in his life. actually he started recording right around the turn of the last century and together with irish tenor john mccormack for rca victor made the recording industry what it became.<br /><br />when caruso and mccormack were at their heights you had to practically inherit a ticket to see either of them perform live. but a lot of immigrant italian and irish families had a phonograph and a record or three of either of these men. it's why both became the legends that they are.<br /><br />what the film does have is some beautifully staged operatic arias done by mario lanza, a taste of what he might have become had he the discipline of a caruso to stick to opera. the great caruso won an oscar for sound recording and received nominations for costume and set design.<br /><br />mario himself helped popularize the film with an rca red seal album of songs from the great caruso. unfortunately due to contractual obligations we couldn't get an actual cast album with ann blyth, dorothy kirsten, and jarmila novotna also.<br /><br />though blyth sang it in the film, lanza had a big hit recording of the loveliest night of the year further helping to popularize the great caruso.<br /><br />if you're looking for a life of enrico caruso, this ain't it. if you are looking for a great artist singing at the height of his career, than you should not miss the great caruso.	0
the great caruso was the biggest hit in the world in 1951 and broke all box office records at radio city music hall in a year when most ""movergoers"" were stay-at-homes watching their new 7"" motorola televisions. almost all recent box office figures are false --- because they fail to adjust inflation. obviously today's $10 movies will dominate. in 1951 it cost 90c to $1.60 at radio city; 44c to 75c first run at loew's palace in washington dc, or 35c to 50c in neighborhood runs. what counts is the number of people responding to the picture, not unadjusted box office ""media spin."" the genius of the great caruso was that the filmmakers took most of the actual life of enrico caruso (really not a great story anyway) and threw it in the trash. instead, 90% of the movie's focus was on the music. thus mgm gave us the best living opera singer mario lanza doing the music of the best-ever historic opera singer enrico caruso. the result was a wonderful movie. too bad lanza would throw his life and career away on overeating. too fat to play the student prince, edmund purdom took his place --- with lanza's voice dubbed in, and with the formerly handsome and not-fat lanza pictured in the advertising. if you want to see the great caruso, it's almost always on ebay for $2.00 or less. don't be put off by the low price, as it reflects only the easy availability of copies, not the quality of the movie.	0
i like it because of my recent personal experience. especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite. the characters in the firm did not really enjoy their ""real"" lives, but they did enjoy themselves, i.e. what they were. the movie did a good job making this simple day a good memory. a good memory includes not only romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful european city, but definitely about the deeper discussion about their values of life. many movies are like this in terms of discussion of the definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or some sort of those. before sunrise dealt with it in a nice way, which makes the viewer pause and think and adjust her breath and go on watching the film. before sunrise did not try to instill a specific thought into your head. it just encouraged you to think about some issues in daily life and gave you some alternative possibilities. this made the conversations between the characters interesting, not just typical whining complaints or flowing dumb ideas. you would be still thinking about those issues for yourself and curious about the next line of the story. the end was not quite important after all. you could got something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie. movies are supposed to be enjoyable. this is an enjoyable movie and worth of your time to watch it. i am on a journey too. the movie somehow represented some part of me and answered some of my questions.	0
jesse and celine (ethan hawke and julie delpy) are two strangers on a european train. the two come from widely different backgrounds, he's american and she's french, after they talk a bit on the train jesse manages to get celine to get off the train and explore vienna with him. during the next several hours the two wander vienna taking in all that the city has to offer and become madly infatuated with each other. but will this newfound relationship last past sunrise.<br /><br />this wonderful romantic-comedy is a breath of fresh air to a genre that has been in decline. written and directed by richard (dazed and confused) linklater, ""before sunrise"" never bores because of its' small cast. in fact it flourishes due to the leads that make you love their characters and have a wonderful charisma between the two. smart dialogue makes this a must for romance fans.	0
amazing movie that, in theory, should be boring but is delivered with subtlety and incredible acting that i have long despaired of ever finding. instead of relying on clichés and overly dramatized moments the plot unfolds through a series of incredibly realistic moments. the lead characters are not perfect, and so relating to them as people you could know is easy. the movie is not trying to pull laughs, or push an ideal onto the audience but simply showing us the possibility of true love in any circumstance. <br /><br />i am now restless waiting for the weekend so i can see the sequel. a moving, thought provoking, funny look at love that i think should be an absolute romantic classic up there with casablanca and breakfast at tiffany's. will soften even the hardiest heart.	0
i'm not usually a fan of strictly romantic movies but heard this was good. i was stunned. easily the most romantic thing i've ever seen in my life. stunning. brilliant, sweet, funny and full of heart. the chemistry is flawless as is the writing and directing.<br /><br />ethan hawke and julie delphy are so natural and sweet together you really think they're a couple. <br /><br />the movies grabs you right away and doesn't let go. you can't look away nor can you stop listening to them. even the little moments just melt your heart. <br /><br />this has jumped into the ranks of one of my favourite ever. a masterpiece.	0
an american woman, her european husband and children return to her mother's home in ""watch on the rhine,"" a 1943 film based on the play by lillian hellman, and starring paul lukas (whom i believe is repeating his stage role here), bette davis, lucile watson, george coulouris, geraldine fitzgerald, and donald woods. an anti-fascist, a worker in the underground movement, many times injured, and wanted by the nazis, kurt muller (lukas) is in need of a long vacation on the estate of his wealthy mother-in-law. but he finds out that there is truly no escape as one of the houseguests (coulouris) is suspicious as to his true identity and more than willing to sell him out.<br /><br />great performances abound in this film, written very much to put forth lillian hellman's liberal point of view. it was certainly a powerful propaganda vehicle at the time it was released, as the evils of war and what was happening to people in other countries reach into safe american homes. the movie's big controversy today is that paul lukas won an oscar over humphrey bogart in ""casablanca."" humphrey bogart was a wonderful screen presence and a fabulous rick, but lukas is transcendent as kurt. the monologue he has about the need to kill is gut-wrenching, just to mention one scene.<br /><br />though this isn't what one thinks of as a bette davis movie, she gives a masterful performance here as kurt's loyal and loving wife, sara. her acting tugs at the heart, and the love scenes between kurt and sara are beautiful and tender.<br /><br />the last half hour of the film had me in tears with the honesty of the emotions. lillian hellman is not everyone's cup of tea, but unlike ""the little foxes,"" she has written some truly sympathetic, wonderful characters and a fine story given a casting and production values by warner brothers. highly recommended.	0
i bought the dvd of before sunset and saw it for the first time a week ago. having saw it twice, i couldn't help but missing before sunrise, not because the sequel was not as great, but i felt that these two movies completed each other like no other sequels ever did, every time i finished watching one of them, i feel the need and yearning to see the other. so, i ended up spending the weeks watching both of them repeatedly, i will be quite embarrassed to mention how many times exactly. the most remarkable thing about before sunrise is how you feel the development of the feelings of their characters towards each other. it sounds so simple, the growing of the chemistry, i think other romantic films might think that they succeed to track the development, but to me - who doesn't believe in nora ephron - before sunrise is the first film to really gives the viewers chance to feel it. when i saw it for the first time, about 8 year ago when i was 20, i already liked it. but, i didn't rate it as a ""great film"", it still seemed to me like another thinking persons' feel good movie, linklater was too smart to make it more realistic, it was 10 minutes too long, the characters was too well fabricated, i thought i liked it because it was like a dream and because i enjoyed their conversations, etc. etc.. but now, thanks to before sunset, i feel that's more to before sunrise than what i felt for it before. i saw the elements more clearly: jesse, celine, vienna, their conversations, everything. how each of them are separated element by itself, and they have a chance to mix, the story is just a frame of time, i am no longer feel manipulated. and the freedom that every scene has, as well as its refusal to be overly efficient, how blind i was that those qualities didn't strike me as exceptional when i first saw it! now, 8 year have passed, the more movies i've seen, the more i realize that many movies are just collections of ordered scenes that only exist for the sake of its ending, even movies like pulp fiction or linklaters's own slackers included. the jesse and celine tale avoid that, maybe before sunset is a better example in this case, but before sunrise is also one of few films that its ending is just a consequence of time, not a destination, every single scene has its own life. i don't know whether linklater or anyone else had a sequel in mind when they made before sunrise, but to me, one of the most amazing things about these sequels are how these two films visually contrast each other. before sunrise which i think employs more static angels and brighter color schemes, seems to try to capture the smallest atoms of liveliness surrounding jesse and celine, the world is always full of hope whether or not the characters feel it. meanwhile, i enter the vision of boredom as jesse stuck talking to the journalists in before sunset, and celine's first smile from behind the shelves are the most heartbreaking smile i've seen in a beginning of a film, and the many moving shots after that takes me to a place i don't know with a sadness in me, no matter how beautiful paris is, and no matter how happy i am that they meet again. i'm sorry that i go on this long with my limited english, before sunrise is already an extraordinary film without me pouring my scattered thoughts, and it gets even better with an equally great sequel following it.	0
i must admit that at the beginning, i was sort of reticent about watching this movie. i thought it was this stupid, little, romantic film about a french woman who meets in the train an american and decides to visit vienna with him. i was not actually enchanted about this kind of script, since it continued to make me believe that it is just a movie. still, i watched it! and i was amazed...""before sunrise"" is one of the few films who dare to talk in a rather philosophical way, wondering about the fact that in the moment of our birth, we are sentenced to death, or that it is a middling idea that fact that a couple should rest together for eternity, or that, we, humans, can afford sometimes to live in fairy-tales. <br /><br />the ending was wonderfully chosen (we do not know if they will meet again in six months, at six o'clock, in vienna's station) -in our optimism, we sincerely hope so. the actors acted in a very good manner, so, that, i began to believe that i, myself could live a love-story just like this.	0
american boy jesse took the train to vienna in order to take the plane for usa. on the train he met a french girl celine. although they met the first time, they talked like good friends. when the train stopped at vienna, jesse begged celine to accompany him to have a tour on vienna. then the romantic story unfolded.<br /><br />at first they were cautious. the funniest scene was their listening to cd in music store. they peeked at each other, though their eyes did not contact. after in-depth conversation, they relationship became close. then i saw the most romantic scene that they pretended to call their respective friend. their deep love for each other was expressed completely by words.<br /><br />love is a strange thing. when you really want it, it will not come as you wished. love needs mutual understanding. without it, love will not last long. spiritual harmony is the most important for love.<br /><br />excellent screenplay and performance resulted in huge success of the movie.<br /><br />one of the best romance movies. 9/10	0
the most amazing combination of love and psyche of two young people.presented in the most sublime manner and definitely touches your heart.a rare combination where the sequel surpasses the prequel in both storytelling and intensity of emotions.the movie re affirms your faith in love and pain of separation. the joy of seeing your most beloved is unparalleled and anything can be sacrificed. ethan and julie have essayed eternal characters with such simplicity that gives the movie a sheer joy and love to watch. a must see movie for all the people who believe in true love. by far the most romantic(at least one of them) movie of all times.	0
my watch came a little too late but am glad i watched both this and the sequel together...which makes me compliment the makers of this flick for giving such a pure and basic treatment to the idea of romanticism... and very marginally separating it from the idea of relationships! as a lot has been written about the movie already, it would just be appropriate to highlight few portions of the movie which i personally loved.<br /><br />i think the point where jesse and celine make phony phone calls to their respective friends was a very shrewd way of telling each other what they had meant to each other through a journey not even extending 24 hrs... the curiosity of two people who both think the other has made an infallible impact on the other has been very smartly dealt with...<br /><br />on the plot front , making a romantic story work on pure conversation is not an easy job to accomplish..<br /><br />i believe in romantic flicks of such flavor , the characters are not clearly designed even in the writer's and director's mind. what the actors bring out is what becomes of them .. right or wrong even the idea bearers would find it difficult to justify... to become the character, the life the actor gives has to go beyond instructions and the story...here both the actors do just the right job! kudos..!!!and before sunset is another feather which makes this one even more beautiful!	0
i managed to catch a late night double feature last night of ""before sunrise"" (1995) and ""before sunset"" (2004), and saw both films in a row, without really having the chance to catch my breath in between or ponder on the meaning of each film separately. after sleeping it over, i have to say that i largely prefer the former over the latter, and i shall explain why.<br /><br />before sunrise introduces us with then young actors, ethan hawke (reality bites, dead poets society), only 25 at the time of the film's release; and julie delpy (the three colors trilogy), then 26 (although looking much younger). he is a promiscuous american writer, touring europe after breaking up with his girlfriend; she is a young french student, on her way home to paris. they meet on the budapest-vienna train and spontaneously decide to get off the train together. the two deeply spiritual and intellectual individuals than spend a whole night together walking the beautifully captured streets of vienna, exchanging ideals and thoughts and gradually falling on love.<br /><br />the film has 1990's written all over it: back then, technology was leaping rapidly, the new millennium with all it's hopes and dreams was waiting just around the corner, and young adults like the ones depicted in the film were filled with love of life and passion for the future. the characters of jesse (hawke) and celine (delpy), with all their flaws and inconsistencies (celine's accent, if by mistake or on purpose, was half american-half french, and it swinged from one spectrum to the other, breaking the character's credibility), were a mirror of the time. watching the naive couple swallow life with such meaning and excitement, acting all clichéd and romantic yet managing to have the audience fall for them as well, is what really made this movie work for me. the fact that the director doesn't let you know if their relationship continues after the film or not makes it all even more worth while.<br /><br />all in all, sunrise is a dreamy stroll through the urban landscapes of vienna, a well told classical romantic rendezvous, and a film i will definitely return to for further insight sometime in the future.	0
this is a slow moving story. no action. no crazy suspense. no abrupt surprises. if you cannot stand to see a movie about two people just talking and walking, about a story that develops slowly till the very end and about lovey-dovey romance, don't waste your time and money. <br /><br />on the other hand, if you're into dialog, masterful story telling, thought provoking ideas and finding true love in the fabric of life then this is your movie. i recommend you watch this movie when you are most alert, though, because the pace, the music and the overall tone of the movie can put you in a woolgathering mood. it's truly fantastic. i really mean that.<br /><br />ethan hawke and julie delpy are annoying with their mannerisms at times but, thankfully, the chemistry between the two makes the acting very natural, warm and tender. they act and feel each other out from the very beginning, making you feel as an intruder.<br /><br />in their conversations there are excellent commentaries on many subjects that will provoke thought and conversation between you and your partner. i thought it was too deep and too diverse for such young characters but i may be underestimating their intelligence. still it did not ruin the movie.<br /><br />the overall story is very simple which i think gives the movie it's charm and ultimately it's power.<br /><br />bottom line: the movie's flow is slow. the dialog is fascinating. the story builds gently, systematically and substantive. the build up to the finale is satisfying and in the end rewarding.	0
after a chance encounter on the train, a young couple spends a single night strolling the streets of vienna, discussing life and love. the primary reason to see ""before sunrise,"" is to watch a young julie delpy deliver her lines. as ""celine,"" this sexy, brainy, soulful brown-eyed blond is sort of a cross between brigitte bardot and joni mitchell as they were in their mid-twenties. risking overstatement, celine is practically the ideal woman, unusually beautiful and very feminine while being natural, unpretentious, introspective, and selflessly loving. we can easily forgive that she is a bit eccentric and talks a blue streak, for her sincere, intelligent remarks are occasionally penetrating. further, her varied expressions are nothing short of captivating and she speaks english with a french accent that is very endearing. <br /><br />if there is a fly in the ointment of this good movie, it would have to be her unkempt and disheveled costar. ethan hawke as ""jessie"" comes off like a vaguely appealing slob, sort of a maynard g. krebs of the nineties. attempting to appear detached and nonchalant, he sort of drags himself through certain shots. his pants fit poorly, his tee shirt is coming untucked, his wavy dark hair (his most attractive feature) needs a good washing, and someone really should have showed him how to properly trim his youthful goatee. nevertheless, he is supposed to represent an unwashed youth on a two-week train ride around europe, so the look he has cultivated is probably pretty genuine. his oft-cynical observations and wry sense of humor seem to impress the unapologetically romantic celine, although she is occasionally disturbed by the extent of his alienation. when he finally admits to her that he is utterly sick of himself and likes being near her because he feels like a different person in her presence, we know he is getting somewhere. <br /><br />after blowing their collective funds on a series of cafes, bars, and silly diversions, they agree that because they may never see one another again, they should make the most of it. jesse bums a bottle of red wine off a sentimental bartender so that he and his newfound lady love may repair to a local park in the middle of the night to lie on the grass, looking up at the moon and the stars and watching the sun come up. <br /><br />given his boundless luck in the romance department, it is especially irksome when jessie, as the very definition of a naive jerk, foolishly allows this wonderful young lady to slip from his grasp. he contents himself with a half-baked plan, quickly devised at the railroad station when he bids her adieu, to reunite at the same spot in half a year. when the appointed time comes, you just know this beautiful and unusual girl will be involved with another, perhaps even married and pregnant. for whatever reason, she probably won't show, while jesse, who ends up working at target or (if he's lucky) the local library, will go back to vienna, desperate to see her again, only to wind up alone.<br /><br />despite what for me was a very discouraging conclusion, ""before sunrise"" is a beautiful movie. i highly recommend both it and the sequel, ""before sunset."	0
when i saw this movie in the theater when it came out in 1995 via a free advanced screening, i was totally enchanted and would have gladly paid to see it. i was sorry when i talked to many people afterwards who had also seen it and who were totally disappointed with it and how it ended. i, on the other hand, felt completely the opposite. i was totally satisfied with the outcome and everything else. people i talked to said there was too much talking! plus they were unhappy because they felt that the ending left you wondering about the fate of the two characters. i found these observations to be absurd and to also be painful evidence of how the majority of the american movie-going public seems to have a tendency to want easy-to-follow stories in films with not too much complex and intelligent dialogue lest they get confused. they also like to be spoon-fed tidy endings--happy or sad. this disgusts me. nobody wants to be challenged anymore??? and as for the ending (and i don't want to be a spoiler), i am totally content because i know in my heart that these two characters will see each other again. it's all about your own personal faith in romance and destiny. it's a very personal film that doesn't speak to all people. but it certainly spoke to me. give it a chance! be patient with it! richard linklater has crafted a very lovely film with a beautiful story set against the beautiful background of the city of vienna. watching it makes you feel as if you yourself are strolling through the city streets along with the characters. as if you yourself were tripping through europe on a eurail pass. it's very intimate. plus, ethan hawke and julie delpy do an exquisite job of bringing the complex script to life. they must have improvised during some parts and it works well. they have a great chemistry in their roles. their awkwardness as strangers getting to know each other in the beginning is very believable and you can truly feel the romance and bonding develop between them as the movie progresses. i get the feeling that this was a very personal work for mr. linklater and i deeply respect him for getting this film made. it definitely touched me and i hope it touches others just as much. bravo for romance!!!	0
"ever since i can remember and i'm only 18 my mother and i have been and continue to watch older movies because well i find them much more rewarding in the long run (but hey don't get me wrong i do love the movies we have today just not as much as i love movies of the 40s and 50s) anyways, now i have to say the moment i started watching the movie my eyes were glued to the tv. of course my favorite character was the grandmother played by lucile watson. but i loved the way betty davis and her family was portrayed. the children...did not act like children in the slightest. but there is good reason for that, having had to hid and run most of your life, seeing the awful things children saw those days destroyed their innocence. so people saying ""oooo i hated how the kids acted...blah blah blah"" read between the lines and know they saw things children should not see.<br /><br />paul lukas...dear paul did an amazing job!!! now i know many people are mad that he go the oscar and bogie didn't but hey they both did amazing jobs so i think it could have gone either way. but lukas' performance was so amazing that by the end of the movie i was reduced to tears. i loved this movie so much and recommend it to anyone!! :-d"	0
"this movie is intelligent. that is, more than most other movies, it transcends the least common denominator - stupid people will probably not appreciate it. the story also relies heavily on dialogue. it has some parallels to lost in translation, although before sunrise is much brighter, somehow less abstract, and simply a lot better.<br /><br />the script, the characters and even the slightly surreal atmosphere feel totally realistic. the actors play absolutely brilliantly. rarely have i seen a movie where the script and the acting has melted this perfectly together.<br /><br />the dialogue moves into very personal issues, with the risk of becoming a little over the top. it does, however, stay on the right side almost all the time, although i found a few moments a little awkward and embarrassing. balancing on this fine line demands outrageously talented actors. sometimes, it yields great results, and overall this movie is simply stupendous! only very, very rarely is ""love"" in films depicted in a way that i find trustworthy and realistic. every time that is achieved, the result is fantastic. i think the stunning and apparently timeless beauty of the female lead actress helped quite a bit in this respect. she still looks stunning in this film, 12 years after.<br /><br />this is simply a gem of a movie that you can't miss. one of the best movies i have seen from the 1990s!"	0
"before sunrise has many remarkable things going on, almost too many to fit into one review like this, but it's suffice to say that it's one of the most observant character studies of the nineties, maybe even in all of contemporary cinema, to be observant not about love, per-say, so much as it's about a human connection. how does one fall in love at first sight? no one does, at least that's deep down the consensus that linklater wants to show with his film. and *yet* there is the possibility of as intense a connection, of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time. linklater here gives us the story of celine and jessie, a french girl and an american boy who get off the same train heading to vienna, and on the way there start to talking about things, at first arbitrary, then personal (jessie seeing death for the first time in his great grandfather). jessie persuades celine to go along with him on a night out on the 'town', in vienna, until his plane the next morning.<br /><br />before sunrise gives jessie and celine, in the midst of the gorgeous vienna scenery and locales to go on and on about subjects that have a lot of importance, and in a sense is about the act of having conversations, of what it's like to watch people having one leading into another and another. here it's often about relationships and commitments, as jessie and celine tell stories sometimes somewhat inconsequential, or seemingly so, and another that may tell a lot about their essential qualities. we hear confessions of desires for other loves, or what weren't really loves, of being part of a family or part of an upbringing that may or may not inform how you'll love your life, of what it means to believe or not believe in some religious form, or just to have some connection to any faith and the soul (i loved the bit about the quakers in the church), and sometimes laced with cynicism or skepticism. jessie may be more responsible for that last part, but what's fascinating about the film is that it's never exactly cynical itself, just commenting upon cynicism that lays in the concerns of men and women at that age of their lives.<br /><br />meanwhile, it's always great to see ethan hawke and julie delpy in these roles, where they're not incessantly annoying in that 90s generation-x mode, but are the kinds of people where if not in the central conceit of the film, which isn't a bad one at all but a necessary one, one might think to find walking along the streets of a city somewhere. the conceit is that of an old romantic picture ala brief encounter, only here intimacy is expressed in the central characters either between each other, where sweet asides are actually acceptable (""i have to tell you a secret"", jessie says, and then leans in for a kiss, ho-ho), or in the little moments that pop up with other people along the way. i loved the scene with the poet, where it's very cinematic a thing to suddenly find a random romantic bit player in the midst of a romantic picture with such beautiful words at his disposal, or with the palm reader and how the reactions from jessie and celine are that we might share, but really are seeing them do it first-hand. all the while hawke and delpy embody the roles interestingly- we can see how neuroses are being formed already for their adult lives- as it may lead off into the future...<br /><br />featuring splendid cinematography and a script with an ear for natural wit and a true sense of what it means to have a moment of happiness, however self-contained, as it may lead into something more. who's to say you can't suddenly be attached to someone, if only for less than 24 hours, and be that much more attached than a married couple? this is perhaps linklater's thesis, but there's more to it than just that. it's a very dense film, and one that will have me calling back to it repeatedly. one scene especially, which is both cheesy and brilliant is when the two of them are talking 'on the phone' in front of each other mimicking their expositions might go to the other's friend. a+"	0
"this is truly truly one of the best movies about love that i've ever seen. closely followed by none other than ""before sunset"", which technically isn't another movie at all, since it's about the same two people and the same romance.<br /><br />this is ""love"" in the real world. ok, that's only if most people are as intelligent and eloquent as the leads in the movie. reading the other reviews, it pleases me to know how so many other folks are crazy over dialog-based movies as well. and this is what makes ""before sunrise"" so good. the dialog is perfect. it's so real, so engaging and funny. it's hardly a surprise that jesse and celine fall in love, 'coz you fall in love with them at the very same time.<br /><br />my favorite scene is the one in the coffee shop, where they pretend to phone their best friends, with the other pretending to be said best friend. it's perfect. brings you back to the very moment when you fell in love for the very first time in your life.<br /><br />i must say that if you have a choice, do watch ""before sunrise"" before watching ""before sunset"". if like me, you watched ""sunset"" first, it's hard to shake off the feeling of pity and sadness for the two young lovers throughout the entire show.<br /><br />once again, the greatest romantic movie in my books. wonderful acting, excellent script, and beautiful locations. young love, at it's best."	0
richard linklater's beautifully directed mixture of youthful romance and paris travelogue is one of the 90's best thinking person's romantic movies. julie delpy turns in one of the decade's most engaging performances as the parisian lass who spends a day with stranger-on-a-train ethan hawke. the dialogue (and there is oodles of it) is sometimes meandering and overly precious, but this portrait of two young wannabe-lovers making a romantic, intellectual, and spiritual connection to one another is full of wonderfully amusing, touching and insightful moments.	0
"sweet and charming, funny and poignant, plot less but meaningful, ""before sunrise"" (1995), the third movie of richard linklater, is dedicated to everyone who ever been in love, is in love, or never been in love but still dreams of it and hopes to find it. it is one of the very rare movies that is/should/will be equally interesting to teenagers, their parents and even grandparents. it seems a very simple little movie with no spectacular visual effects, car chases, or long and steamy sex scenes. two young people in their early 20s, two college students (american tourist ethan hawke who is returning home after the summer in europe and the french student julie delpy who goes to paris to attend the classes in sorbonne) meet on a train. they are attracted to each other instantly even before they start talking, they hop off the train in vienna where they walk around exploring the city all night. they talk and fall in love. that's it, that's the movie. it could've been boring and silly but instead, it is a lovely, believable, clever, and moving romance that only gets better with each viewing (at least, for this viewer). high praise and my sincere gratitude go to the director and writers for delivering two charming characters, superb writing, always interesting and witty dialogs, two awesome performances, and the atmosphere of magic that falling in love is. julie delpy, who looks like a botticelli's angel, is great in portraying smart, independent, and incredibly attractive young woman."	0
first let me say that before sunrise, like all movies, is not a movie for all tastes. it appears some folks are less smart to acknowledge this fact, but it is remarkable to contemplate the kind of outright dislike this small harmless movie generates from some people. for me, like most folks here, before sunrise struck a deep chord in me, i was truly stunned, moved, inspired by it. this is a movie that ultimately benefits from more than one viewing. it creates some of the most awesomely unforgettable feelings and emotions you can possibly imagine. it is impossible to imagine this world without ever thinking about the kind of inspirational feelings i got from it.<br /><br />the movie works as a communion of two fragile souls that are starting to get to know each other. it is very intelligent and inspiring, not so much in how one conversation necessarily ties into the next or the significance of the topics of jesse and celine's discussions, but rather the little nuances, the perfectly articulate responses they provoke from each other. it captures an honest, romantic, yet fleeting human emotion that is starting to blossom in the awesomely sublime viennese milieu; it convinces us that their evanescent relationship might be the greatest compliment in the world. and what happens after that night is open for debate, but i never doubt that they won't each other again.<br /><br />the facile comments by rockythebear and the below user are hopeless examples of a doctrinaire dissenter unwilling to accept and respect those who love this movie.<br /><br />see it and it may change your way of life.	0
i watched this movie 10 years ago. and have watched it on video an average of once a year since. it's the type of movie that's timeless, because the themes are universal, yet the stories and conversation are so personal. it's also one of the very few movies that capture you from frame one til the credits roll, despite the fact that there are, really, just two (very involving) characters. this owes a lot to the engaging acting by hawke and delpy, who make us believe that they are actually jesse and celine. this is also the first movie i saw that mentioned reality tv, and now, the phenomenon is rampant! i love the way this movie just envelops the audience in its space, and makes you think, however jaded you may be, that you are one of those characters. it also made me want to ride the train around europe! i have not met anyone who has not been able to relate to this movie. maybe that speaks about myself, my friends, or just the sheer genius of this movie.	0
there are many people in our lives that we meet only once in our lifetime, but for some reason or another we remember those persons for the rest of our lives. these once in a lifetime friendships occur between people with long distances between and there are always some natural reasons for why we don't meet these people anymore. we don't always even know their names, as we are never presented to each other, and sometimes we even forget to ask what their names are. it's funny how common humanity makes occasional friends and we like to keep it as such, because reuniting might spoil fond memories, or we don't know do they. we are too afraid to check that out.<br /><br />the movie 'before sunrise' just caught me watching it. i never had intention to watch it through, but because the discussion between the couple seemed interesting, i gave a look for the rest of the film. i didn't know what to expect from it, but nor did the young couple. they had time to discuss with each other until the sunrise and anything could happen before they had to separate. i believe this film has had good reviews because the situation is something that everybody on this planet has at least once or twice lived through. it makes us all think about all those people we have met only once in our lives.	0
"if you are a traveller, if there is a fire burning into your heart, if you'd call ""home"" every place on earth, but none of them can give you enough, if you are always looking for the next thing and if you believe the other part of your soul is somewhere out there, see this movie and you'll find out a little, but wonderful, piece of life sitting next to you."	0
"many of the criticisms on this thread seem to pick a comparison of this film with ""the mortal storm"" or ""casablanca"". everyone is entitled to compare films they choose, but the similarities of ""the mortal storm"" and ""watch on the rhine"" are clearly the problems of refugees threatened by the nazi juggernaut, while the main comparative point brought out with ""casablanca"" is the seeming unjust treatment of humphrey bogart in 1943 by the academy of motion picture arts and science, because they chose paul lukas instead for the best actor oscar. it does not strike me as totally wrong. lukas had a good career in film (both here and in england - he is the villain in ""the lady vanishes""), and this performance was his best one. bogart had more great performances in him than rick blaine (for instance, he was ignored for sam spade in ""the maltese falcon"" and roy earle in ""high sierra"" two years earlier, both of which were first rate performances, and he would not get an oscar for his greatest performances as fred c. dobbs in ""the treasure of sierra madres"", the writer/murder suspect in ""in a lonely place"", and captain philip francis queeg in ""the caine mutiny"" afterward - he got it for charley in ""the african queen""). i think that bogie should have got it for the role of dobbs, but it did not happen. but lukas was lucky - he got it on the defining performance of his lesser career. few can claim that.<br /><br />to me the film to look at with ""watch on the rhine"" is based on another play/script by hellman, ""the searching wind"". they both look at america's spirit of isolationism in the 1920s and 1930s. ""the searching wind"" is really looking at the whole inter-war period, while ""watch on the rhine"", set in the years just proceeding our entry into world war ii, deals with a few weeks of time. therefore it is better constructed as a play, and more meaningful for it's impact. <br /><br />the film has many good performances, led by lukas as the exhausted but determined anti-nazi fighter/courier, davis as his loyal wife (wisely keeping her character as low keyed as possible due to lukas being the center of the play's activities), coulouris as the selfish, conniving, but ultimately foolish and ineffective teck, lucille watson as the mother of davis and geraldine fitzgerald (as coulouris' wiser and sadder and fed up wife), and kurt katch, who delivers a devastating critique (as the local embassy's gestapo chief) about coulouris and others who would deal with the nazis. it has dialog with bite in it. and what it says is quite true. it also has moments of near poetry. witness the scene, towards the end, when coulouris is left alone with lukas and davis, and says, ""the new world has left the scene to the old world"". hellman could write very well at times.<br /><br />given the strength of the film script and performances i would rate this film highly among world war ii films."	0
"it was by accident that i was scanning the tv channels and found this wonderful film about two beautiful human beings who become attracted to each other in a very innocent and virgin like approach to each other. ethan hawke (jesse) ""tape"" '01 and julie delpy (celine) ""er"" 94 tv series (nicole). this gal and guy, will warm your very heart and soul and make you think deeply into your past relationships and how you really wish you had followed your hearts strings with a guy or gal you deep down loved and lost track of over the years. jesse and celine have great conversation, and deep eye contact with a great magnetic explosion between the two of them. i am looking forward to the sequel to this film in 2004 and if you have viewed this film, you will feel the same way."	0
"before sunrise"" is a wonderful love story and has to be among my top 5 favorite movies ever. dialog and acting are great. i love the characters and their ideas and thoughts. of course, the romantic vienna, introduced in the movie does not exist (you won't find a poet sitting by the river in the middle of the night) and it isn't possible to get to all the places in only one night, either (especially if you're a stranger and it's your first night in vienna). but that's not the point. the relationship of the two characters is much more important and this part of the story is not at all unrealistic. although, nothing ever really happens, the movie never gets boring. the ending is genuinely sad without being ""titanic"" or something. even if you don't like love stories you should watch this film! i'm a little skeptic about the sequel that is going to be released in summer. the first part is perfect as it is, in my opinion.	0
i want céline and jessie go further in their relationship, i want to tell them that they were made for each other, that in a lot of moment in the film we want they to die for each other. their story is what we ever wanted and probably most of us never reached. this is about love but not stupid things like in ""notting hills"" or those kind of movie. this is life and i did believe in them, i did believe they were falling... this was so clever and touching. i have just finished to view it a minute ago and i m still there... i want to go to vienna. i want to see them as soon as possible again.<br /><br />i have to say i was now becoming misanthropist and felt like if love was just a fake, a concept, but with this movie i realized that maybe somewhere, somehow and some when, something could really happen.<br /><br />i'm french and didn't know very well july delpy despite kieslowski ""three colors : white""... now i have to see her other works because she looks like an angel and got a perfect acting.<br /><br />i saw ""before sunset"" (the sequel in paris) a few days before i saw ""before sunrise"" and their is no matter. they are both masterpieces. proof that you don't need to impress the eyes with technology to get pure feelings. i'm sorry for my english which i m trying to best.<br /><br />franck in france	0
while traveling by train through europe, the american jesse (ethan hawke) and the french celine (julie delpy) meet each other and decide to spend the night together in austria. on the next morning, jesse returns to united states of america, and celine to paris. <br /><br />""before sunrise"" is one of my favorite romances, indeed one of the most beautiful love stories i have ever seen. it is a low budget movie with a very simple and real storyline, but the chemistry between ethan hawke and julie delpy is perfect, and the dialogs are stunning. the direction is amazing, transmitting the feelings of celine and jesse to the viewer. i have just completed my review number 1,000 in imdb, and i choose ""before sunrise"" for this significant number because it is a very special film for me. i cannot understand why this movie was not nominated to the oscar, with such a magnificent screenplay, direction and performances. yesterday i have probably watched this movie for the third or fourth time, and i still love it. my vote is ten.<br /><br />title (brazil): ""antes do amanhecer"" (""before sunrise"")	0
before sunrise is romance for the slacker generation. richard linklater's romantic drama is an offbeat telling of a dream come true for most people. the film depicts romance in all it's glory, but without any of the pitfalls that befall most couples; and in short the film is about two people that have a relationship that's as close to perfection as relationships will ever come to - with just one problem, the problem of time. while most relationships wind down with time, this one keeps going strong throughout and time itself is the only thing that wears out. before sunrise is certainly not the typical sentimental 'hollywood romance', which is another aspect that puts this film leagues ahead of the pretenders. the story follows two people, jesse; an american and celine; a french girl that meet on a train into vienna. they instantly connect, and after telling her his awful idea for a television show and almost getting off the train, jesse asks celine to join him for the day in the picturesque city of vienna...<br /><br />before sunrise works principally for two reasons - realistic acting and an immense script that builds the characters through their thoughts and feelings and thus allows us to get to know them as we do the people in real life. this allows the characters to be free, and it's easy to believe that these are real people and not just actors working from a script. this also allows us to feel for the characters for who they are, and not merely because they're the protagonists. this kind of realism is hard to capture as, at the end of the day, we as the audience know that they're watching a film and not observing real life; but before sunrise represents one of the truest to life exhibitions of realism ever to be seen on screen. a truly great script cannot work on it's own, and needs great actors to deliver it to an extent that does it justice, and although i'm not a fan of either julie deply or ethan hawke; on viewing this film, there is nothing you can do but give them both respect. i don't know whether they were in character or just playing themselves, but when a film is this good; it hardly matters.<br /><br />in a film like this, it is the writing that's the most important thing, and contained within the script are several observations about life, most of which i personally could relate to. this represents what richard linklater has achieved with this script as not only does it create and build the characters, but it also manages to expose what true love is, along with several other aspects of life. the fact that not all the anecdotes are relatable to me personally again represents the brilliance of writing. everyone is different, and so different parts of the script will appeal to different people. there could be certain aspects about one person that one person loves and another hates; and that's the case with the musings in this script. adding to the beauty of the film is the city of vienna. the city itself isn't really important to the film as this is a story that could have taken place just about anywhere - but it makes for some lovely visuals and the upbeat, energetic romance that blossoms throughout the movie is matched by the beauty of the location.<br /><br />before sunrise is simultaneously beautiful and captivating. richard linklater has created something that is rare in the world of cinema; a film that captures the beauty of life without ever going over the top or being overly sentimental. before sunrise is what it is. and what it is, is pure cinematic brilliance.	0
this has to be one of the most sincere and touching boy-meets-girl movies ever made. while ""rebel without a cause"" and ""say anything"" deliver nice portrayals, this movies strips down useless subplots and hollywood divergences. this movie focuses purely on watching the budding of a beautiful romance. you never doubt for a second that the film will lead towards the romantic pairing of these two people. you almost immediately sense the synergy and the chemistry between jesse and celine, and it is simply pure joy to watch them find it. this movie is mostly all dialogue -based. but, every conversation between these too is greatly intriguing. what makes this pairing so romantic is how real it is. how in all that conversation, while often having no real bearing on anything critical, you can sense the nuances as these two become more fond and trusting of each other. this is exactly they way you would dream that you meet that special someone. and what makes it so true is that it is not even too fantastic to believe. this could be what would happen if you had been confident enough to strike up a conversation with that person you noticed somewhere random. and what puts the icing on this film is the magnificent backdrop of vienna in which this film takes place. it just adds to the feeling of romantic nirvana that the film suggests. and no matter how many times i watch this film, i don't think i will ever tire of that.	0
this movie is not about entertainment, or not even a movie you want to see to pass the time. this movie is a genuinely a display of true love that can only come from god. one cannot help but be touched deeply by looking at this movie. we have several dimensions of love that contributes to the value of this movie. there is the divine love of god that is beautifully portrayed. god's love transcends the heart and mind and endures and is eternal. there is the love in a marriage. while the main character grapples with his wife's disease, he realizes through god's love that he loves his wife more than he could ever imagine. he knows that he and his wife are one and can never be separated. finally, you have the love of child and parent. the kids in the family come together and realize that nothing else matters except that love conquers fear. dear friends, love is not love unless it comes from god, because god is love and love comes from god. talk to someone and let them know you love them. love does no good unless it is given to another. i pray this movie can inspire and change the lives of everyone who sees it. amen!!	0
forget the campy 'religious' movies that have monopolized the television/film market... this movie has a real feel to it. while it may be deemed as a movie that has cheap emotional draws, it also has that message of forgiveness, and overall good morals. however, i did not like the lighting in this movie... for a movie dealing with such subject matter, it was too bright. i felt it took away from the overall appeal of the movie, which is almost an unforgivable sin, but the recognizable cast, and their performances counteract this oversight.<br /><br />definitely worth seeing... buy the dvd.	0
this movie deals with one of the most feared geriatric diseases among the aging today. as one who has encountered a number of families who are facing the potential of alzheimer's or who are in the formative stages, i would suggest that every health care giver recommend this movie to any family facing the trauma of this disease. the movie is designed primarily to speak to the family of the patient and reaches into the very heart of the struggle. casting is excellent and the dramatic portrayal is outstanding with a very commanding plot line.	0
i wasn't expecting to be so impacted by this film portraying a family just like the one you'd expect to be living next door. they are ordinary flesh-and-blood people, not like the typical hollywood fare. they face an all too common problem--debilitating illness. but the story-line grips the heart with a powerful lesson. casting, script, direction, and acting flow together with a surge that draws the viewer deep into the story. give this film your full attention and its message will truly inspire.	0
lillian hellman, one of america's most famous women playwrights, was a woman with a mission. her leftist views were not well regarded at the time in the country. in her memoir, she recounts her trip to the then, soviet union, as she was intrigued with the so called successes achieved by that system. ""watch on the rhine"" must have come as a result of those years. the left wing in america, as all over the world had an issue with the rise of fascism, not only in europe, but in japan as well.<br /><br />""watch on the rhine"" was a play produced on broadway eight months before the pearl harbor attack by the japanese. in it ms. hellman was heralding america's entrance in world war ii. the adaptation is credited to ms. hellman and dashiell hammett, her long time companion. as directed for the screen by herman shumlin, the film was well received when it premiered in 1943.<br /><br />we are introduced to the muller family, when the film opens. they are crossing the border to the united states from mexico. they are to continue toward mrs. muller's home in washington, d.c., where her mother, fanny farrelly, is a minor celebrity hostess. the mullers, we realize are fleeing europe because of the persecution there against the opponents of the advancing totalitarian regime in germany. in fact, we thought, in a way, the mullers could have been better justified if they were jewish, fleeing from a sure extermination.<br /><br />we find out that mr. muller has had a terrible time in his native land, as well as in other places because his outspokenness in denouncing fascim. little does he know that he is coming to his mother-in-law's house that is housing one of the worst exponents of that philosophy.<br /><br />the film offers excellent acting all around. it is a curiosity piece because of bette davis' supporting role. paul lukas, repeating his broadway role, is quite convincing as kurt muller, the upright man that wants to make a better world for himself and his family. mr. lukas does a great job portraying kurt muller, repeating the role that made him a stage luminary on broadway.<br /><br />the other best performance is by lucile watson, who plays fanny farrelly, the matriarch of this family. geraldine fitzgerald is seen as marthe de brancovis, a guest of the farrellys, married to the contemptible teck de brancovis, a nazi sympathizer, played by george coulouris. beulah bondi, donald woods, and the rest of the supporting cast give good performances guided by mr. shumlin.<br /><br />the film should serve as a reminder about the evils of totalitarian rule, no matter where.	0
this was a good film with a powerful message of love and redemption. i loved the transformation of the brother and the repercussions of the horrible disease on the family. well-acted and well-directed. if there were any flaws, i'd have to say that the story showed the typical suburban family and their difficulties again. what about all people of all cultural backgrounds? i would love to see a movie where all of these cultures are shown - like in real life. nevertheless, the film soared in terms of its values and its understanding of the how a disease can bring someone closer to his or her maker. loved the film and it brought tears to my eyes	0
a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie. it's based on a novel of the same title, which was equally good, though different from the film. really made you think about how you'd respond if you were in the shoes of the characters. recommended for anyone who has ever loved a parent, spouse, or family member--in other words, everyone!<br /><br />though the production isn't quite hollywood quality--no big special effects--still, the values and ideals portrayed more than make up for it. and the cast did a wonderful job of capturing the emotional connections between family members, and the devastation that occurs when one of them becomes ill.<br /><br />you don't want to miss this!	0
i just watched this movie for the second time, and enjoyed it as much as the first time. it is a very emotional and beautiful movie, with good acting and great family values. inspiring and touching!	0
when i found the movie in the schedule for christmas, its title did not sound familiar to me since i have not read the novel and had not heard anything about the film. yet, having read the content, i decided to spend my christmas evening on watching the movie. the effect surprised me totally: i do not remember when i last saw a film in which every single moment involved me. a vow to cherish is, without any doubt, one of the movies that now constitutes a real surprise i have received from cinema. here are some arguments of mine why i consider this film a highly underrated piece of good cinema. <br /><br />first, the entire content is particularly educational. it has something to offer to the modern audience - pure right faith and some answers for the universal questions. is there a need for christ in our times? does love still matter? what for is there faith? what is the logics of burden and suffering in life? is there really someone by my side i can always trust? the movie provides the answers through the content since all that happens to the characters may as well happen to any of us.<br /><br />second, the movie is exceptionally humane. the main characters experience inner struggles and cope with extremely hard decisions. is it better for kyle david denman) and teri (megan paul) to start their own lives and forget about the family or retain the values they were taught at home? is it better for john (ken howard) to leave ellen (barbara babcock), his sick wife, and start a new happy life with julia (donna bullock), a woman he falls in love with? in fact, ellen no longer recognizes him... yet, he decides to vow his wife eternal fidelity. had john's rebellious brother, phil (d. david morin), better go on his easy life although it does not bring him satisfaction or once start to think seriously of his life. phil's prayer to god in the park is a psychological masterwork of universal aspect of humanity. these words could be as well said by everybody no matter of where, when or how they live.<br /><br />third, the movie is a great portrayal of family, not very popular nowadays: there are problems, yet, there is always something more powerful that gets these people together. this ""something"" is love and trust. i know that it may seem a bit idealistic. not all families can rely on fidelity and it may not be as simple as that. nevertheless, it is a very educational aspect and a realistic one.<br /><br />fourth, the entire film focuses on people's mutual help. if we want to live happy lives in our society, we must understand one thing: we have to help one another. alexander (ossie davis) is an example of such attitude. at the beginning of the movie, we see him talk to john about praying. later, he helps his brother. alexander is a kinda ""angel"" that is sent to john and his family. isn't it possible that we may become angels to one another?<br /><br />fifth, the artistic features are also worth attention. performances: barbara babcock gives an authentic performance as ellen and although she has a difficult role, she does a perfect job. consider, for instance, the moment she appears at school and badly wants to teach again. ken howard is also memorable as the faithful husband. picture: the most memorable for me was the scene of john and ellen in the park walking on the fallen leaves (autumn) while the sunshine (love) spreads everywhere. i interpreted as a sort of symbol: even if there is sorrow, this can always be illuminated by light and joy...<br /><br />a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie that realistically showed to me what it means to love, what fidelity is as well it once again proved to me how beautiful it is to live and believe. at the end, i would like to quote the profound words from the movie i found very touching and hope you will also do <br /><br />kyle to his uncle phil: yes, he (john brighton) lives according to the bible. but nobody forces you to do so. yet, according to what rules do you live?	0
for all of you that don't speak swedish: the swedish [original] title of this film; ""rånarna"" translates into something in the line of ""the robbers"". this fact is the main problem i have with the film, cause it's not really about the robbers at all. it's about a young woman working for the swedish police researching robberies. a regular desk job one would think, but this girl is soon out on the field taking matters into her own hands, as the story goes, even shooting one of the robbers... exactly: we've seen this before. the fact that there's a rather interesting twist to the plot halfway through doesn't really help as the ending is just as cliché as the first two thirds of the film.<br /><br />what saves it from being just another mainstream film is the fact that it's masterfully executed in all ways, that the actors are as great as they are and don't overact and that the director really manages to keep it as thrillingly exciting as it is for the most of the story.<br /><br />one thing that i really loved about this film is the fact that it's music sets the right mood when it's needed, but is absent for the rest of the time, which gives a nice sense of reality to the shootouts and car-chases spread throughout the film. a nice touch! the fact that michael persbrandt is one of the few swedish actors that often tend to get typecasted sadly hurts the film as you know that he's not going to just play the boyfriend of the heroine and be a supporting character in the background, but that's something you have to neglect.<br /><br />all in all it's an entertaining film that steals more money in it's plot than time from you. 7/10	0
even this early in his career, capra was quite accomplished with his camera-work and his timing. this is a thin story -- and quite predictable at times -- but he gets very good performances out of his cast and has some rather intricate camera moves that involve the viewer intimately. the first part looks like a cinderella story, though anyone with brains can see that the bottom will fall out of that -- the rich 'prince' will lose his fortune.<br /><br />nonetheless, because of his good cast and fast pace, it's easy to get caught up in the clichés. then the movie does become more original, as the married couple have to find a way to make a living. the ending is very predictable but satisfying. i also want to compliment the title-writing: very witty and fun.	0
but sadly due to rights issues, that almost certainly will never happen. transcripts of joe bob's commentary on the sub b movies he screened are available on the internet, but they don't quite capture his twang inflected delivery, which was a real hoot. nowadays, joe bob (real name: john bloom) is confined to doing the supplemental features of such classics as ""i spit on your grave"" (featuring what some exploitation fans call the greatest gang rape on film of all time), and jason x, one of the most reviled friday the 13th sequels of all time (the series was never the same once it left paramount). all i could think when they canceled it was: ""damn, where else am i going to get my fill of flesh ripping, blonde jokes, and horror trivia every saturday night? does this mean i have to get a life now?"" sadly, it does. but there'll always be a place in my horror hungry heart for ""monstervision."" long live the drive-in!	0
monstervision was a show i grew up with. from late night hosting with penn and teller to the one, the only, joe bob briggs. the show kept me up friday nights back in my high school years, and provided some of the best drive-in memories to ever come outside of the drive-in.<br /><br />without a doubt, the best late night television ever. if you didn't stay up, you were missing out.<br /><br />i know john bloom and joe bob live on, but i want them back where they belong...monstervision! question...did anyone else sit through all 4 hours of ""the swarm"" ? q:)<br /><br />long live monstervision!	0
i remember seeing promos for this show before it appeared back in 1993. i was 8 at the time, and now at the age of 22 it feels weird to have seen this cult show start and end and to look back on it.the 90's all of a sudden seem so far away, what a great decade. anyway i used to watch monstervision all the time, as i am a huge fan of monster flicks and horror films. it was like the 90's version of chiller theater. if mst3k can get dvd's why not joe bob's show, at least monstervision was more interesting and informative. a lot of joe bob's comments and info on the films were just hilarious. most of the movies shown on the show were b or c grade but it showed a lot of a house films as well like the hammer films from england which are top notch as well as many with the stop motion majesty of ray harryhausen. many were oddball flicks that you wouldn't see anywhere else like the the japanese sci-fi movies besides of course godzilla which is familiar to almost everyone and independent movies like metal storm and motel hell. with the new decade of film preservation and more independent minded directors, i think monstervision would be a good show for ifc to pick up, since they already have a hit with the ifc grind house show. i'm sure this show will be picked up again for nostalgia reasons some day, i guess will have to wait and see. until then ""thats great television""!	0
probably my all-time favorite movie, a story of selflessness, sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause, but it's not preachy or boring. it just never gets old, despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years. paul lukas' performance brings tears to my eyes, and bette davis, in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles, is a delight. the kids are, as grandma says, more like ""dressed-up midgets"" than children, but that only makes them more fun to watch. and the mother's slow awakening to what's happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling. if i had a dozen thumbs, they'd all be ""up"" for this movie.	0
i'll tell you a tale of the summer of 1994. a friend and i attended a canada day concert in barrie, and it was a who's who of the top canadian bands of the age. we got there about 4am, waited in line most of the morning, and when the doors opened at 9am, we were among the first inside the gates. we then waited and waited in the hot sun, slowly broiling but we didn't care, because the headliners were among our favourites. at one point, early in the afternoon, i sat down and dozed off with my back to the barrier. i was awakened to my shock and dismay by a shrieking girl wearing a rheostatics t-shirt. this is the reason i have hated the rheostatics to this day. there's nothing reasonable, nor taste-determined, nor really anything except their fandom. snotty of me, isn't it? so, i, in my hatred of the band, have denied myself the delight that is whale music.<br /><br />desmond howl had it all. it's hard to say what he's lost, since he lives in a fantastic mansion wedged between the ocean and the mountains (the bc region where the movie was shot is breathtaking). the life most of us dream of is dismantled by dreams, phantoms, and his own past, until the day a teenaged criminal breaks in...and, trite as it sounds, breaks him out.<br /><br />canadian cinema suffers from several problems. generally, a lack of money, as well as an insufferable lack of asking for help (as if somehow the feature would cease to be canadian) leads to lower production values than american or british films, and most people don't like to watch anything that sounds or looks like, well, not like an american film. next, canadian screenwriters often seem so caught up in being weird that they lose sight of how to tell a good story, and tell it well. third, they seem to think that gratuitous nudity (often full-frontal) makes something artistic. i'm sure anyone who watches enough canadian movies, especially late at night on the cbc, knows exactly what i'm talking about. it's almost like a ""don't do this"" handbook exists out there somewhere and canadian film-makers threw it out a long time ago.<br /><br />in the 90s and 00s, however, some films (such as bruce mcdonald's work and the brilliant c.r.a.z.y.) have broken this mold, and managed to maintain what makes them canadian, while holding onto watchable production values and great stories. whale music is such a film, on the surface. deeper than just its canadian-isms, it's a deeply moving story of a man who's lost his grip, through grief and excess, who is redeemed by music then by love. and that redeems even the rheostatics. :)	0
i enjoyed this film yet hated it because i wanted to help this guy! i am in my fifties and have a lot of friends in the music business...who are now still trying to become adults....no more fans,groupies,money etc...and they are having such a hard time adjusting to a regular life...as they see the new bands etc getting the spotlight...it is almost like they have to begin anew...this film is a testament to what a lot of the old rockers from the 70's and 80's are going through now....and that's where i find the film sad and depressing.but it portrays the life of an old rock star-abandoned and lost-in a believable way.the young girl who arrives at his decrepit home reminds me of hollis maclaren (outrageous)...and she is one lady in a film you will cheer for. this film is a must have for folks in their 50's who have seen the rise and fall of bands,people who knew the members, and have watched them hurt as age creeps in,and popularity fades.this is an almost perfect movie....sad but in a way positive....because of the whales. a must see!	0
anyone who loves the rheostatics' music is going to enjoy this film. i have some minor complaints, mainly about pacing and the casting of certain actors (not maury) who aren't really convincing in their roles, but i don't have time write a detailed review. i just want to warn anyone who has seen this film or plans to watch this film as presented cbc television in canada: the version that airs are the cbc is like the reader's digest version of whale music---don't watch it. it cuts out entire scenes and subplots (if you can them that) from the film. the cbc, which presents most of films untouched, took half the guts out of whale music. i don't know why. it's horrible what they did to the film. rent the video or watch it in a theatre, but don't watch it on cbc television.	0
i was in a bad frame of mind when i first saw this movie. for some reason it clicked on all my levels, tensions in a family, loneliness and the want of someone to share your life with. it didn't hurt that the someone to share your life with was such a beautiful girl as claire (cyndy preston). i also bought the sound track to this movie (very hard to get). loved it and hope it will someday come out on dv	0
i was amazingly impressed by this movie. it contained fundamental elements of depression, grief, loneliness, despair, hope, dreams and companionship. it wasn't merely about a genius musician who hit rock bottom but it was about a man caught up in grief trying drastically to find solace within his music. he finds a companion who comes with her own issues. claire and des were able to provide each other with friendship and love but more importantly a conclusion to events which had shaped their life for the worst. <br /><br />des is an unlikely character by todays standards of a rock star. yet he has musical genius. he also has an event in his past that has made him stagnate, while things around him literally go to ruins. his focus is creating his whale music, in fact it becomes an obsession for him.<br /><br />claire is the streetwise kid that needs a place to stay. she finds hidden talents while being in des company. she also finds a mutual friend that accepts her. she learns to trust him over a period of time.<br /><br />these two find love with one another. not the mind blowing, sex infused kind of passion, but a love where friendship and understanding means more. for two people who have been hurt, they find trust together.	0
a friend of mine recommended this movie, citing my vocal and inflective similarities with des howl, the movie's main character. i guess to an extent i can see that and perhaps a bit more, i'm not very sure whether or not that's flattering portrayal.<br /><br />this is a pretty unique work, the only movie to which this might have more than a glancing similarity would be true romance, not for the content or the style of filming or for the pace of dialogue (whale music is just so much more, well, relaxed.) but instead that they both represent modern love stories.<br /><br />in general i'm a big fan of canadian movies about music and musicians (for example i highly recommend hard core logo) and this film in particular. it has an innocent charm, des is not always the most likeably guy, but there's something about him that draws a sterling sort of empathy.	0
my first exposure to ""whale music"" was the rheostatics album of the same name, that i bought around 1993. i was reading the liner notes and the band said the album, which remains in a prominent place in my collection, was inspired by canadian author paul quarrington's book.<br /><br />i picked up the book a few months later and devoured it! an amazing read! i have since re-read the book numerous times, each time finding some new element to desmond and his desire to complete the whale music.<br /><br />i found the film in 1996, on video. i haven't had a lot of good experiences with canadian film, but this one worked for me. the role of claire could have been cast differently, but overall i think that paul quarrington's vision was transfered nicely from the book to the screen.<br /><br />maury chaykin gives a moving performance as the isolated genius. the movie deals with family relationships, love, and finding someone who understands. i would strongly recommend ""whale music"" to not only music fans, but anyone who has ever lost something or someone, and tried to find their way back to the world.	0
walking the tightrope between comedy and drama is one of the toughest acts in cinema. how do you get laughs out of other people's misery and not start feeling bad when it goes on too long?<br /><br />well, this surprising little gem of a movie will deliver great big laughs, beautiful scenery, and quite a good buzz as well. i particularly like the concept that a trick of history made alcohol legal since white europeans liked it, and marijuana illegal, since 'those other races' used it...undoubtedly true and exposes a racial side to the marijuana laws so openly flaunted by populations all over the world.<br /><br />an extraordinary ""dvd extra"" commentary...two of them in fact...run thru the whole movie with both the actors, and then again with the writers. i kept seeing things i was sure were not in the first movie, but then realizing how easy it is to miss much of the subtle comedy on the first take. what a hoot! don't miss it! 9/10 stars	0
<br /><br />this is definitely a 'must see' for those who occasionally smoke a reefer in their secret hide-out, trying to avoid being caught by parents, teachers, the police, etc... the protagonist is a lady in her forties, living in her mansion, breeding orchids, and absolutely unaware of the fact that her so-called rich and truthful husband is actually broke and cheating on her. when he all of the sudden dies, she is confronted with the truth. the bailiff comes by to tell her that she is in a huge debt. she doesn't know what to do, until her gardener tells her about the recent success of marijuana in britain. she decides after some long thinking to get rid of her flowers and start breeding pot instead... the story is quite original, the performances outstanding! i can think of only a few movies that made me laugh more than this one. still, the melodramatic touch is present. the film is typical british: the jokes aren't vulgar, there is no violence involved. it shouldn't be mentioned that it is recommended to have taken a few draughts before watching 'saving grace'. it will be so much more fun! especially the scene with the 2 old ladies in their tea shop is hilarious. i thought my jawbones would burst. 9/10	0
this is film that was actually recommended to me by my dentist, and am i glad he did! the blend of british humor (should i say, humour?) and the reality of a lost, middle-aged widow trying to maintain her lifestyle were a hoot. add to that mix the reality of what it takes to actually grow pot (those plants under the bushes were not going to make it without the tlc they received), and it is a truly hilarious, yet touching film. i laugh every time i conjure the vision of all the bar patrons sitting in their lawn chairs with sunglasses on counting down the lights! maybe it's just my mendocino county blood, but the brits definitely got this one right!! 10/10	0
it may (or may not) be considered interesting that the only reason i really checked out this movie in the first place was because i wanted to see the performance of the man who beat out humphrey bogart in his casablanca (10/10 role for the best actor oscar. (i still would have given the oscar to bogie, but paul lukas did do a great job and deserved the nomination, at least.) well, i'm glad i did check this movie out, because i enjoyed it immensely. i think the movie did preach a little, but not only did i not mind, i enjoyed the speeches and was never bored with them.<br /><br />the acting was outstanding in this movie. i especially enjoyed paul lukas, lucile watson (rightfully nominated for an oscar), bette davis (wrongfully not nominated), george coulouris and, oddly, eric roberts, who plays the middle child. i really enjoyed his character: an odd-looking boy who talks like some sort of philosopher. he just cracks me up. even the characters name (bodo) is funny. <br /><br />the ending, in which lukas's character was forced to do something he considered wrong even though he was doing it for all the right reasons, worked for me as well. i agreed with why he felt he had to what he did, and i understood why he couldn't quite explain it. the message this movie makes is a good and noble one, the scenery (meaning the house) is beautiful, and the acting is the excellent. watch this movie if you ever get a chance.<br /><br />9/10	0
this is an hilarious movie. one of the very best things about it is the quality of the performance by each actor. from the largest role to the smallest, each character is vivid, unforgettable and so understandable. it can also make you laugh so hard your health will improve.	0
a sweet little movie which would not even offend your grandmother, ""saving grace"" seems cut from the same cloth as a half-dozen other british comedies over the past two years...underdog is faced with adversity, finds the strength to challenge and learns something about him/herself in the process.<br /><br />widowed and thus broke, grace is a master gardener, and is enlisted to help her friend/employee matthew grow his pot plant. he's been doing it all wrong, so grace helps him out. they realize that she is the perfect person to harvest pot, which they can both benefit from. he enjoys smoking, she needs to raise funds to pay her mortgage. <br /><br />highlight is grace travelling to london to deal some of her merchandise, dressed in what looks like the white suit john travolta wore in ""saturday night fever"" and therefore sticking out like a sore thumb. <br /><br />blethyn is always watchable, and you can't say that about a lot of people..well, i can't, anyway. ferguson is very good, and tcheky karyo, who i liked in ""la femme nikita"", is memorable. <br /><br />not profoundly moving or insightful, but immensely entertaining, and at a brisk 90 minutes, feels like a walk with friends. 8/10.	0
i love this film. it's one of those i can watch again and again. it is acted well by a good cast that doesn't try too hard to be star studded.<br /><br />the premise of a newly widowed housewife who turns to selling pot to make ends meet could have been made into an americanised turd of a movie or an action thriller. either would have killed the film completely.<br /><br />the film plays out like an ealing comedy with a terrific feel-good factor throughout.<br /><br />it is worth watching just for the scene with the two old ladies and a box of cornflakes...

charming doesn't even begin to describe ""saving grace;"" it's absolutely irresistible! anyone who ventures into this movie will leave with their spirits soaring high (haha).<br /><br />grace trevethyn (brenda blethyn) has just lost her husband, but her problems are about to get a whole lot worse. her dearly departed has left her with no money and outstanding debts. faced with losing everything, she has to find out a way to get a lot of cash...fast! she gets an idea when her gardener, matthew (craig ferguson) asks the town-famous horticulturist to give him advice on a plant he is secretly growing. grace immediately realizes that his plant is marijuana, so they decide to use her gardening skills to grow a lot of top-quality weed, and then sell it to pay off her outstanding debts.<br /><br />the most notable quality about ""saving grace"" is its likability. every character is extremely sympathetic, and, save for the first 20 or so minutes, the film is non-stop good cheer. everyone wants a happy ending for everyone, even if it means turning a blind eye to some rather illegal activities.<br /><br />the acting is top-notch. brenda blethyn is one of britain's finest actresses, and here is why. she turns what could have been a caricature into a fully living and breathing individual. she's a nice lady, but she's not stupid. craig ferguson is equally amiable as matthew. he's a deadbeat loser, but he's so likable that it doesn't matter. the rest of the ensemble cast fits in this category as well, but special mention has to go to tcheky karyo. the french actor always has a aura of menace about him, and that suits him well, but he also has great comedy skills.<br /><br />nigel cole finds the perfect tone for ""saving grace."" it's all about the charm. one of the problems i have with british humor is that all the energy seems to be drained out of the film. not so here. the film is thoroughly likable and always amusing. that's not to say that ""saving grace"" is just a likable movie that will leave you with a grin and a good feeling. while this movie is not an out and out comedy, it does boast two or three scenes that are nothing short of hysterical.<br /><br />if there's any problem with the film, it's that the climax is a little confusing. the questions are answered though, and the ending boasts an unexpected twist.<br /><br />see ""saving grace,"" especially when you're having a bad day.	0
i saw it last night on tv, and was quite delighted. <br /><br />it is sort of the movie which makes you feel nice and warm around heart, and believe that there is still some goodness in the world (all the neighbours pretended not to see what grace was doing in order to help her and protect her- the old policeman is my favourite), although you know that this story is not quite realistic.<br /><br />i loved acting (they all seemed just as ordinary, common people, living in small picturesque english coast town) but the greatest thing in the movie was the wit and humor it has! just remember the scene in the shop with two old ladies after they had their ""tea""!!<br /><br />perhaps the ending was a little bit confusing, but it didn't stop me from really, really enjoying the whole story!	0
""saving grace"" is never riotously funny, but it delivers quite a few good laughs and i enjoyed it to a significant degree. brenda blethyn is a fine actress, and does a good job at portraying widower grace, who resorts to growing marijuana to pay off her massive debts. the supporting cast also does a fine job. french actor tchecky karyo has a funny little role. the premise alone is appealing. the idea of an over-the-hill woman growing and smoking pot sounds funny enough. and the film plays around with the premise wisely every now and then. of course, there are flat moments, like one where two elderly women mistaken grace's marijuana leaves for tea leaves and they start pulling childish antics at the store where they work. that was a mindless gag that didn't quite take off. the film's tone is downbeat and occasionally dull, but i got enough laughs to give this english import a recommendation. <br /><br />my score: 7 (out of 10)	0
saving grace is a feel good movie with it's heart in the right place. grace is recently widowed and realizes her late husband left her with a lot of debts. she could lose her lovely house and sees no other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana. she's living in a beautiful village where most viewers would love to live and the villagers are all wonderful people most viewers would love to have as neighbors. there's only one thing wrong with this picture and that is the way it portraits the effect marijuana has on it's user. it's obvious none of the actors or writers of this film actually ever did smoke the stuff. the way the villagers act after smoking a joint is ridiculous and only supposedly funny. it's precisely in those scenes that wit is replaced by english slapstick, and that is a pity in a movie that is none the less very enjoyable.	0
after her oscar-nominated turn in ""secrets & lies"", brenda blethyn starred in the equally great ""saving grace"". and let me tell you, this is not the sort of movie that you find every day.<br /><br />after her husband commits suicide, grace trevethyn (brenda blethyn) discovers that his irresponsible financial decisions have left her with a massive debt. fortunately, she finds a way to make ends meet: marijuana. that's right, grace starts cultivating it.<br /><br />every aspect of this movie was played to great effect; there isn't a dull moment anywhere in it. and i sure didn't see that end scene coming! but anyway, you gotta see this movie. you just might feel more than a little festive after seeing it. if nothing else, it might function as a good lesson about knowing one's finances. but of course, there's a lot more to it than that!	0
this light hearted comedy should be enjoyed for entertainment value. it gets quite hysterically funny at times, but if you haven't spent any time on 'that' side of the tracks you will miss the comedy when it erupts.<br /><br />the cast of characters meld well together and are quite believable in their roles. how grace handles meeting her dead husbands girlfriend was well played. she's a true lady. and, my favorite is grace's white pimp suit that she wears.<br /><br />i highly recommend this flick to anyone who wants to laugh out loud, who cheers for the underdog or just wishes to watch something different.	0
for muslim women in western africa, married life at the hands of abusive husbands can be very hard . the community may not explicitly endorse such behaviour, but equally, they may not yet be ready to see it as criminal, an attitude which of course enables it to continue. fortunately, the letter of the cameroonian law promises equality to all, and this documentary follows the real life exploits of various female practitioners in the cameroonian legal system as they attempt to secure justice for a number of women and children. what is notable (apart from the uplifting central story) is how, in spite of their informality, the courts are actually pragmatically progressive, if a case is actually bought. the program also gives a fascinating insight the whole cameroonian life-style, which (aside from the awful crimes committed in the featured cases) seems amazingly emotional and joyous compared with that enjoyed by inhabitants of europe or north america. and while i concede that this comment may betray naiveté on my part, this attitude appears to be captured in delightful pidgin-english they speak. overall, this is a terrific little film, and much more fun to watch than you might imagine.	0
yet another example of what british cinema can achieve: a simple story, told and acted well. brenda blethyn gives a layered and warming performance as the recently widowed and financially straitened grace, ably assisted by a solid supporting cast. the ""quirky small town"" card gets played to the hilt, similar to many tv series and films that have come from the british isles in recent years (ballykissangel, hamish macbeth and others come to mind). like the forementioned, this film makes use of some ravishingly beautiful rural scenery, in this case the wet and wild cornish coast.<br /><br />some viewers might find wholesale acceptance of cannabis use a bit challenging, others might find the ending just a little too cute and safe. but it's an enjoyable spliff, to be sure.	0
a delightful gentle comedic gem, until the last five minutes, which degenerate into run of the mill british tv farce. the last five minutes cost it 2 points in my rating. despite this major plot and style flaw, it's worth watching for the character acting and the unique cornwall setting. many fine little bits to savor, like the tense eternity we all go through waiting for the bank approval after the clerk has swiped the credit card...made more piquant when we're not - quite - sure the card is not maxed.	0
i saw saving grace right after it came out on video. since then it's become one of my favorites! the plot isn't particularly complex but it doesn't take away from the entertainment. it's chuck full of comedic moments and has a very endearing quality to it. the characters are what makes the movie so good. they each have their own quirky qualities which adds to the humor, the two old ladies played by linda kerr scott and phyllida law leaps to mind. superb acting was done by all, particularly brenda blythen. she and craig ferguson were great together in pulling off some of the funnier moments. if you're looking for a good comedy i'd definately recommend this movie!	0
this movie is inspiring to anyone who is or has been in a tough jam, whether financially or emotionally. you will definitely laugh, which is the best medicine! :) left in a bad financial situation when her husband dies, grace has to find a new way to make some money and it's not exactly legal which adds to the humour. even my boyfriend liked it so don't think that it's a chick-flic.	0
excellent view of a mature woman, that is going to lose everything (even the pruner has a mortgage). the way she gets involved into this special ""business"", the innocence, and the true love that exists between the people of a little town, it's mixed perfectly to give us as result a fresh, light and funny comedy. i couldn't stop laughing with a very funny scene of two old ladies in a drugstore.<br /><br />i love european films, and with movies like this one, my opinion grows stronger. a movie that i also recommend with my eyes closed, in this same genre, is waking ned devine.<br /><br />saving grace, a comedy that many friends enjoyed as much as myself. you will love it.	0
saving grace is a nice movie to watch in a boring afternoon,when you are looking for something different than the regular scripts and wants to have some fun. i mean,the whole idea of this movie and all the marijuana in it is such a craziness! it was the first movie i watched with this theme(drugs/marijuana) that is not really criticizing it,only making jokes about it. grace trevethyn is a widow,who lives in a small town in u.k. and has many financial problems because of her dead husband, who committed suicide since he was full of debts. the problem is that grace, who imagined to have some money saved for her, discovers that she needs to pay all of her husband's pounds in debts to not lose all of her things, specially her house that she loves so much. she never worked before, and is in a tragic situation until matthew,her gardener who is very found of smoking pot, decides to make a partnership with her in selling marijuana in large scale.	0
great actors, an oscar nominee actress, stunning scenery, good strong story line and more laughs than you can fit into my new handbag (and thats quite big). this film was brilliant. it was beautifully acted in the more serious scenes and the funny moments were . .well, side splitting. i have never heard a cinema audience laugh so much, and tears were streaming down my cheeks during the 'stoned ladies in the tea shop' scene. well done to the british film industry and to craig ferguson whose magic ingredients have made sure this is one of my favourite films of the year, if not of all time.	0
i just thought it was excellent and i still do. i'm grateful we're still able to see different stuff from what hollywood almost floods us with. saving grace is smart and enjoyable - those who feel offended by the marijuana thing better go see the america's bride sort of movie.<br /><br />saving grace also shows that a funny movie doesn't have to be stupid. i was laughing my ass off during most of it but also pondering questions about what was the female lead character supposed to do to pay her deceased husband's debts.<br /><br />in a nutshell - a witty storyline with typical english humour and good acting and directing. you couldn't ask for more.<br /><br />7/10.	0
it's a bit easy. that's about it.<br /><br />the graphics are clean and realistic, except for the fact that some of the fences are 2d, but that's forgiveable. the rest of the graphics are cleaner than goldeneye and many other n64 games. the sounds are magnificant. everything from the speaking to the sfx are pleasant and realistic.<br /><br />the camera angle is a bit frustrating at times, but it's the same for every platform game, like banjo-kazooie and donkey kong 64.<br /><br />i got this game as a christmas present in 1997, and since then, i have dutifully gotten 120 stars over 10 times.	0
mario's first foray into the world of 3-dimensions is incredible. miyamoto's masterpiece was reason enough to buy a nintendo 64 when it was released in 1996 and it still holds all of it's charm today. this game is an instant classic that set the standard for 3d adventure/platform games.	0
sisters in law will be released theatrically on march 24th in sweden. a good occasion for our nordic friends to discover this original and thoughtful documentary. it was shown in göteborg together with a retrospective dedicated to kim longinotto, ""director in focus"" of the festival. she gave a master class, very much appreciated, telling about her method as documentary filmmaker and told the audience about the special circumstances which led her to shoot sisters in law twice : the first version got lost for good, so a second shooting was organized and the film turned out to be different at the end. a pretty awful problem happened, in this case, to create the possibility of a very strong movie.	0
although super mario 64 isn't like the rest of the games in the series, it is still a classic and is every bit as good as the old games. games with this much replay value are few and far between. plus, this game has so much variety. there are 15 levels each with several different tasks you can do, and many other hidden tasks. the game isn't very challenging, but its lack of challenge doesn't take away from the game at all. once you beat it, you'll want to erase your game and start again. and its just as much fun the second time, or third time, or two hundredth time. a must own for any nintendo 64 owner, and is a reason in itself to own a nintendo 64.	0
super mario 64 is undoubtedly the greatest game ever created. it is so addicting that you could play it for hours upon hours without stopping for a break. i've beaten the game 4 times, but i've never gotten all 120 stars...(i've gotten 111)...but i hope to achieve them eventually. even though i didn't officially play this game until i was seven in, i loved watching my sisters play it. now i am 13 and still play this, erasing games and starting over again.<br /><br />the graphics are unbelievable for an early n64 game. the gameplay is addictive. the controls are great. the levels are tough, but not impossible. the bowser fights are challenging.<br /><br />i would like to tell you more, but why don't you just get it for yourself? put the x-box 360, ps3, and the wii away and go find yourself a nintendo 64 and play this amazing, wonderful game.	0
one of the funnest mario's i've ever played. the levels are creative, there are fluid controls, and good graphics for its time. there's also a multitude of crazy bosses and enemies to fight. sometimes the levels get frustrating, and if you leave out some of the hard levels and still, need to get more accomplished to fight a boss, it can be annoying. another complaint is the camera angle; though it works fairly well most of the time, it can be a pain in certain situations. if your a big time mario fan; this ones for you. even if your not a huge fan of him, i'd still recommend this one. its a big game, and getting what you need can take a while, but it's very satisfying. good for playing in short bursts of time. it will almost certainly hold your interest; it sure does hold mine!	0
when i first got my n64 when i was five or six,i fell in love with it,and my first game was super mario 64.and i loved it!the graphics were great for it's time,a good plot,great courses and above all,the best music i heard in a nintendo game.<br /><br />i don't remember the plot completely,but i think princess peach was kidnapped by bowser,and mario has to rescue her.the object of the game is to get 120 stars from the curses in the castle.each had about five or six challnges to get the stars.there are secert parts of the castle,where you can get more stars.but of course,you have beat bowser.*i think there are three levels to beat bowser on* lets start with the characters.mario is the main character,and gets helpful advice from toad,so he is basically one of your only alliances.i heard that luigi and yoshi are in the game towards the end.the main villain is bowser,and there are a bunch of other characters like boo and goomba.the characters are really great.<br /><br />next,how about the graphics?people say gameplay is more important then the graphics,and i agree completely.but with he great plot,there are great graphics.especially for it's time.i have a whole bunch of other nintendo games like 007 and their graphics don't compare to super mario.bright colors,great effects and awesome sound effects.i found the graphics in the water courses very very good.next to the bowser world ones,it has the best graphics in the game.<br /><br />now,the music.this is my favorite part of the game.growing up,when i played this at a young age,i'd gladly leave the game on all night so the music would put me to sleep.especially the music from jolly roger bay,which was peaceful and wonderful.there are others that are great too,especially in,once again,the worlds with bowser,are the ones that stick with me the most and are my favorites.<br /><br />this game was my favorite past time as a developing gamer,and i love it.this game gets 10/10 or *****(5)/*****(5) go play the game!	0
or at least one of the best. i think this is a very fun and very cool game for the n64. bowser is up to his usual shenanigans (yeah it's a dumb word but the only one i can think of) and mario must stop him again. this game is very fun to play, and contains lots of nostalgia to me. the only bad thing about it is the graphics, which are awful to today's standards, but everything else is pretty good (especially the little mini-games you can unlock) it's the second best n64 game (the first best is conker's bad fur day) that i recommend to any mario fan, or any fan of platform games. it beats out mediocre super mario sunshine any day.<br /><br />9/10 or: a	0
yes, that's right, it is. i firmly believe that the n64 and the weird looking controller were both designed just so this game could be made. it was amazing the first time i saw it, with its huge environments and colorful characters, and its amazing now. the play control is perfect, the graphics are beautiful, and it has that nintendo charm that is always so intangible but undeniably there. a must have for any n64 owner, and a reason to get an n64 for everyone else.	0
rated e <br /><br />i never actually owned a nintendo 64 but i have played one many times.in my opinion along with conkers bad fur day, super mario 64 is one of the best video games for the nintendo 64 system.i have played this game plenty of times and its good every time.if you have an n64 and don't have this game you should try to find it.the original super mario bros games were side scrolling video games but super mario 64 has a 3d mario in a nice 3d environment.the game is sort of weird but there is plenty of things you can do in the game.you play as super mario and once again you must rescue princess and the 120 power stars from bowzer.now you can do it in a 3d environment.super mario 64 is a very fun and good n64 game and i recommend it.<br /><br />10/10	0
this game is amazing. really, you should get it if you don't have it. although it is ancient now it was amazing when it came out. i believe that this game will always be a classic. it's just as good a super mario world or so. when i was young, my friend and i would sit and play this game for hours trying to beat it which we eventually did. it's not nearly as advanced as super mario galaxy, but if you are a fellow mario fan it is essential. it's fun entertaining and challenging. everything you could want out of a fantasy game except for good graphics, (well it did come out in 1996.) rock on 4eva mario luigi and yoshi!!! nintendo is the best!	0
mario is invited to princess peach's castle for cake. when mario gets there, he finds out that bowser has kidnapped her! mario must save the day again. unlike the 2-d games, mario can explore anything he wants to. he can just roam around, climb trees trying to look for 1-ups, find secrets in levels, and more. you can spend four hours in one level. no time limits. there are 16 worlds, with a number of stages, and there are star doors, which you need a certain number of stars to get into. once you get in these star doors, you must go through a stage and fight bowser at the end of the stage. to get to certain worlds, you need a number of stars to get in. you enter the world by going through a painting. there is so much stuff to do and so many hours of gameplay, i don't see how anyone could dislike this game. it's great. this launch title is the game that insured gamers that the n64 would have a good life. every 3d plat-form game we know of has something in common with sm64. banjo kazooie and banjo tooie are examples that are commonly used. super mario 64 is one of the greatest games in the history of 3d games. 10 out of 10. if you have an n64, buy this game. it's hard to find used, because no one's selling this baby for 5 bucks at the pawn shop. a perfect 10.	0
i have not read the novel, though i understand that this is somewhat different from it; the fact that i rather enjoyed this, coupled with the fact that this really is not my genre, leads me to the decision of not pursuing reading the book. having not read a single word of austen's writing, i really can't compare this to any of her work. what i can say is that almost every line of dialog in this is clever, witty, and well-delivered, as well as the biggest source of comedy in this. this made me laugh out loud a lot, with perfect british and verbal material. every acting performance is spot-on, and paltrow completely nails the role of a kind matchmaker. the characters are well-written, credible and consistent. i did find a couple of them extremely irritating, however, and while i think that at least some of that was meant to be funny, it tended to get repeated excessively, and it honestly wasn't amusing the first time they appeared. the editing and cinematography are marvelous, and everything looks utterly gorgeous. plot and pacing are great, you're never bored. it does end in a *really* obvious manner, but maybe that's what the audience of these prefer. i can't claim that this did not entertain me, it did from start to finish, and i'd watch it again. there is brief language in this. i recommend this to any fan of romance stories. 7/10	0
this amazing documentary gives us a glimpse into the lives of the brave women in cameroun's judicial system-- policewomen, lawyers and judges. despite tremendous difficulties-- lack of means, the desperate poverty of the people, multiple languages and multiple legal precedents depending on the region of the country and the religious/ethnic background of the plaintiffs and defendants-- these brave, strong women are making a difference.<br /><br />this is a rare thing-- a truly inspiring movie that restores a little bit of faith in humankind. despite the atrocities we see in the movie, justice does get served thanks to these passionate, hardworking women.<br /><br />i only hope this film gets a wide release in the united states. the more people who see this film, the better.	0
this is an ok adaptation, but not as good as the tv version. the actors are generally alright but i found jeremy northam rather wet as mr knightley, particularly compared to mark strong in the tv version. gwyneth paltrow is ok and her english accent is pretty good but again, i preferred kate beckinsale's emma. there are excellent support performances from toni collette, juliet stephenson and sophy thompson.<br /><br />the script is often played too much for laughs, the book is a comedy, but there are too many set-piece gags here, and also the frank churchill subplot is almost completely absent.<br /><br />my biggest criticism is the scenery. it is far too lush. england has never been like this. it looks like a chocolate box. only americans would make it like this.<br /><br />despite these criticisms i enjoyed this film but would recommend the tv adaptation more.	0
""emma woodhouse"" gwyneth paltrow (shakespeare in love, duets) has nothing to do with herself but painting, going with her friends on her chariot up and down, saying hello to people in town,"	0
first i bough this movie on vhs than i just had to buy it on dvd, it is on of my favorite movies of all time. i have read the book, but i really think the movie is much better. i loved gwyneth paltrow as emma and jeremy northam as mr. knightley was an excellent chose. he was brilliant!<br /><br />it's a 10/10 movie!!!<br /><br />	0
if you have any clue about jane austen´s production, you´ll now that she repeats the same in each of her novels: marriage, marriage and marriage! in my opinion all the movies made from her novels are a bit boring, but i like austen´s characters, because they all have a certain personality and typical sayings they like to repeat as also in emma. the thing that makes emma good is gwyneth paltrow, she´s very good in her leading role. also the fact that each one of the characters in the movie don´t seem to be able to think anything but how to get a good partner and soon married makes the movie hilarious.	0
emma is a horribly flawed film based on jane austens classic novel. i have not read the book so i really didn't know that much about the plot, and yet i still predicted nearly the entire plot. there were also many scenes that frustrated me because of the bad writing or directing. the film is though for some reason very entertaining and i loved it. of course there were all the scenes i disliked but the majority was well acted and funny. gwyneth paltrow gives one of her best performances as the heroine in emma. the film also stars toni collette(who has okay but has been much better) ewan mecgreger(who has also been better but he is still very good here) alan cumming(who i have never really been impressed with and is pretty much the same here) and jeremy northam(who's performance is rather wooden at first look but actually fairly subtle, even if that was not what it needed) there have been much better adaptations of jane austen books but this one is still very entertaining and worth watching.	0
a slight, charming little movie to be sure, but a superbly-crafted one. gwyneth paltrow shines in this early showcase for her british accent, and the cast assembled around her all lap up the dialogue. this came out around the time of sense and sensibility, and i'm sure i don't know why that one garnered all the oscar attention. emma is jane austen's most accessible and least stuffy story, told well.	0
"emma"" was a product of what might be called by the first great jane austen cycle of the mid-nineties, and it was recently shown on british television, doubtless because of the interest in the author created by the second great jane austen cycle which started with ""pride and prejudice"" two years ago. we currently have in the cinemas the austen biopic ""becoming jane"", and itv have recently produced three tv movies based on austen novels. these include ""northanger abbey"", the only one of the six major novels not to have been filmed previously, so the cycle should now be complete. no doubt, however, there will be more to come in the near future. (there is, after all, her juvenile ""love and freindship"" (sic), the short novella ""lady susan"", and someone, somewhere, has doubtless supplied endings to her two unfinished fragments ""the watsons"" and ""sanditon"". then there are all those austen sequels churned out by modern writers).<br /><br />the main character is emma woodhouse, a young lady from an aristocratic family in regency england. (not, as some reviewers have assumed, victorian england- austen died before queen victoria was even born). emma is, financially, considerably better off than most austen heroines such as elizabeth bennett or fanny price, and has no need to find herself a wealthy husband. instead, her main preoccupation seems to be finding husbands for her friends. she persuades her friend harriet to turn down a proposal of marriage from a young farmer, robert martin, believing that harriet should be setting her sights on the ambitious clergyman mr elton. this scheme goes disastrously wrong, however, as elton has no interest in harriet, but has fallen in love with emma herself. the speed with which emma rejects his proposal makes one wonder just why she was so keen to match her friend with a man she regards (with good reason) as an unsuitable marriage partner for herself. this being a jane austen plot, emma turns out to be less of a committed spinster than she seems, and she too finds herself falling in love, leading to further complications.<br /><br />emma always insists that she will not marry without affection, and when she does find a partner, the handsome mr knightley, we feel that this will indeed be an affectionate marriage. it does not, however, seem likely to be a very passionate one (unlike, say, that of elizabeth bennett and mr darcy). knightley, who is sixteen years older than emma (she is 21, he 37), and related to her by marriage, is more like a father-figure than a lover. much more of a father-figure, in fact, than her actual father, a querulous and selfish old hypochondriac who seems more like her grandfather. when emma is rude to her unbearably garrulous and tedious friend miss bates, it is knightley who chides her for her lack of manners. (his surname is probably meant to indicate his gentlemanly nature- nineteenth-century gentlemen liked to think of themselves as the modern equivalent of mediaeval knights with their elaborate codes of chivalry). both gwyneth paltrow and jeremy northam play their parts very well, but this is not really one of the great screen romances.<br /><br />of the other characters, i liked juliet stephenson's vulgar mrs elton and toni collette's harriet. i know that in the novel harriet was a naïve young teenager, whereas here she is more like the character collette played in ""muriel's wedding""- a gauche, slightly overweight twentysomething, fretting about her chances of finding a man. nevertheless, i felt that this characterisation worked well in the context of the film and did not detract from austen's themes.<br /><br />""emma"" is one of austen's more light-hearted works, without the darker overtones of ""mansfield park"" or even ""pride and prejudice"", and this is reflected on screen. we see a world of beauty and grace, full of stately homes and elegant costumes and fine manners. apart from the ruffianly gypsies, who make a very brief appearance, the only ""poor"" people we see are mrs bates and her daughter, and, as they live in the sort of picturesque rose-strewn thatched cottage which today would change hands for over £500,000, we can be sure that their poverty is relative, not absolute. in emma's world, poverty is defined as not having your own stately home. this is, of course, not a comprehensive picture of early nineteenth-century life, but nobody has ever claimed austen as the regency equivalent of a kitchen-sink realist. sophisticated romantic comedy, combined with a keen eye for analysing human character, was more in her line.<br /><br />i would not rate this film quite as highly as the 1994 ""sense and sensibility"" or the recent ""pride and prejudice""- it tends to drag a bit in the middle, although it has a strong beginning and strong ending- but it is, in the main, a highly enjoyable austen adaptation. 7/10	0
wrapped in gorgeous english country backgrounds, emma is a delicious confection to be relished for dreamy getaways.<br /><br />emma (gwyneth paltrow) is a graceful, intelligent young woman who has just married off her governess--and confidant--to a marriage which emma takes the credit in matchmaking. eager to use her talent in arranging things for the people around her, she decides to match the vicar, mr. elton (alan cummings) with her pretty young friend, harriet (toni collette).<br /><br />the result is a series of mixed signals and mistaken interpretations that end up sorting themselves out, with emma learning that she did not have as much control over events as she thought.<br /><br />the film is full of jane austen's witty and wry characterizations. gwyneth paltrow is at her best, portraying this maiden of a restrained, polite society with wit and ease. her growing romance with the unparalleled mr. knightley (jeremy northam) is the heart of this film. mr. knightley is one of the greatest romantic leading men in films. he is incredibly handsome, in a modest, relaxed way that is irresistible. he is certainly well-matched to gwyneth paltrow. their charming friendship that began when he was 16 and she was an infant, has blossomed as he, a family friend, matches wits with her in an older brotherly fashion that grows into something more. with a wry look or understated jab at emma, northam's knightley is a delight to watch.<br /><br />other wonderful characterizations include the comic juliet stevenson, greta scacchi, ewan mcgregor, polly walker, and the talkative spinster, miss bates, who is very funny.<br /><br />seeming shorter and more flowing than most jane austin adaptations, emma has comic rhythm that promises true enjoyment.	0
i'm a huge jane austen fan and besides being a feature-length film (a true fan wants to see as little left out as possible and that can only be achieved in a mini-series) it was really great. gwyneth paltrow really captures the slightly clueless but well-intentioned rich girl and jeremy northam is mr. knightly with his poise and nobility. i wasn't thrilled with ewan mcgregor even though i like him very much as an actor but didn't feel it spoiled the movie at all. like i said, as a jane austen fan there were things i would have liked to have seen included that weren't but that would have made it much longer than permissible for a feature length film and as it was i felt they really encapsulated the story well. i've seen every adaptation of this book and felt this was the best one!	0
this is a powerful documentary about domestic abuse in the cameroon. the ""sisters"" in law are female lawyers and judges who in 2004 successfully prosecuted husbands for abusive treatment of their spouses and won one woman a divorce she desperately wanted through a muslim council. it is rather long -- about two hours -- but fascinating in terms both of the individual plaintiffs and defendants and the lawyers who successfully represented them in court rooms presided over by female judges. it will leave you, as it left me, with many questions about exactly how this change occurred. how and when did women come to occupy positions of authority in the cameroon? have the several cases featured in this film had a significant effect on the treatment of women generally by their spouses? was the granting of a divorce by a muslim court, against the express wishes of the husband, a one time event? i'm not suggesting that the film makers could have answered these questions. they made the movie two years ago, not yesterday. and the movie they made deserves a wide audience.	0
i saw this movie being a jane austen addicted and always feeling doubtful about cinematographic rendering of the complexity of her novels: well, this transposition is simply accurate, intelligent, delicate, careful, tactful, respectful, intense, in a word, perfect!<br /><br />""emma"" is one of austen's most delightful and funny novels, thanks to overall irony pervading situations and characters. the movie respected this subtle irony, not disregarding the comic element (miss bates above all). what engaged me in the novel, and the movie renders it clearly, is the deep knowledge of human life shown by the english novelist, and the modern look with which women, men, and their relation are handled, and it is astounding if we think how a woman novelist of the 18th century, who lived almost a secluded life, could grasp such depth and truth about life as she did: that most and still fascinates me. we can feel this modernity throughout the movie: just replace costumes, and use a more current language but the situations, the feelings, the ideas would be extremely modern. i think of the morbid interest in other people's lives, or that insinuating envy which now as ever rule women's relations, and still the difficulty in revealing, and giving expression to one's feelings, especially love: every situation gets a universal and out-of-time value. <br /><br />the cast is really talented and offer very good and extremely brilliant performances: a young gwyneth paltrow is particularly suitable for this role (nowadays she would be probably too mature for it), toni colette is simply great. and how i envied them for the wonderful dresses they could wear! and then, the breathtaking english countryside, where every situation gets such a magic and dream-like dimension... a really enjoyable and deserving movie.	0
well, i guess i'm emotionally attached to this movie since it's the first one i went to see more than 10 times in the cinema ... helping me through my master's thesis, or rather keeping me from working on it!<br /><br />but on watching it again several years (and many many movies) later - what a well-crafted little gem this is! i've never seen gwyneth paltrow in a more convincing performance, and jeremy northam is the perfect mr knightley - where does one meet such a man??? <<<sigh>>> sophie thompson's turn as ms bates is virtuoso acting of the finest (oh, napkins, sorry!) and the rest of the cast is no disappointment either - toni colette brings a lot of muriel to her harriet, and ewan mcgregor is convincingly charming - and alan cumming and juliet stevenson are the perfect ""impossible"" couple!<br /><br />of course the sets and costumes, and the beautiful soundtrack contribute a lot to the feelgood, almost hobbiton-like atmosphere of the movie - although as far as cinematography and art decoration go, it's almost a case of visual overload. very very pretty, but a little more austerity might have conveyed a better sense of period. but the good thing is, the movie doesn't take itself too seriously, and there is plenty of fun - and some pretty cool editing - that keep it from sinking into saccharine merry old england mode.<br /><br />my particular favorite is the ball scene - some beautiful acting and directing here, and the concluding dance summarizes the relationship between emma and mr knightley just beautifully. pity that the final proposal scene goes on for just a little too long - cut two shots (i can think of exactly which ones!) and it would have been much more in keeping with the rest of the movie.<br /><br />gosh, i just realize (by reading the imdb listings) that i've seen jeremy northam in at least three movies without even being aware that it was him - seems he's got a lot more going for him, as an actor, than just being a gentlemanlike english heartthrob! hmm, guess i need to pay my video store a visit...<br /><br />lovely movie. my favorite jane austen adaptation so far - though perhaps ang lee's sense and sensibility is, strictly speaking, the better movie, this one is closest to my heart - and i've certainly seen it many more times! watch it if you can - and don't be too hard on its little imperfections.<br /><br />	0
this is a good adaptation of austen's novel. good, but not brilliant.<br /><br />the cinematography is inventive, crossing at times the border to gimmickry, but it certainly avoids the trap of making this look like a boring tv soap in costumes, given that the entire story is dialogue-driven.<br /><br />the acting is competent. ms paltrow is aloof, as her character requires, but the required distance from the other characters is accompanied by a much less appropriate detachment from her own actions. in other words, she does not seem to care enough of the results of her match-making endeavours. some of the supporting cast is guilty of over-acting - very much in the style that is appreciated on stage but out of place in motion pictures. personally, i had problems accepting alan cumming as mr elton - to no fault of his own, except for having left such an impression as a gay trolley-dolly in ""the high life"" that it is now difficult to accept him playing any serious part. acting honours go to toni collette who manages to radiate warmth, and jeremy northam who pitches his character at just the right level.	0
emma is a true romance. if you love the soppy stuff, charged with wit and folly, you will love this movie! its true to the novel, which is very important, with a few twists added for pleasure. gwen is not one of my fave actreesess but she does justice to a role that required everything that she had to offer in spades. she shines in a role i think no other actress could have done proper justice to. <br /><br />jeremy northam, as the hero. how shocked are you? i never looked upon him as overtly handsome but heck! what the right role can do for you! he looks so good as the sensible, regal mr. k, that i am literally looking at him in a new light. he makes and excellent romantic lead. the charm and character that he brings to his role is wonderful!<br /><br />ewan mcgregor, greta sacchi brings in the rest. a good cast. a good movie. if you are a fan of jane austen, see this movie, along with pride and prejudice - and most importantly, buy the books. it enhances the movie to heights that are extraordinary	0
jane austen would definitely approve of this one!<br /><br />gwyneth paltrow does an awesome job capturing the attitude of emma. she is funny without being excessively silly, yet elegant. she puts on a very convincing british accent (not being british myself, maybe i'm not the best judge, but she fooled me...she was also excellent in ""sliding doors""...i sometimes forget she's american ~!). <br /><br />also brilliant are jeremy northam and sophie thompson and phyllida law (emma thompson's sister and mother) as the bates women. they nearly steal the show...and ms. law doesn't even have any lines!<br /><br />highly recommended.	0
i have no idea how a texan (the director, douglas mcgrath) and the american actress gwyneth paltrow ever pulled this off but seeing this again will remind you what all the fuss about ms. paltrow was in the first place! i had long since gone off the woman and still feel she is rather dull in her oscar-winning ""shakespeare in love"" performance but she gets all the beats right here--she is nigh on perfect as emma woodhouse. she may have won her oscar for shakespeare but she should be remembered for this.<br /><br />of course, she's surrounded by a great supporting cast including toni collette, greta scacchi, juliette stevenson et al...jeremy northam is very appealing as the love interest, even if the script wallows a bit in his declaration of love to paltrow (in the process, allowing all of the tension to drain out of their relationship); several years on, ewan's hair is a little easier to take than it was in '96 and, personally, i find puckish alan cumming a grating presence in anything nowadays. but the standout is, without a doubt, sophie thompson (sister of emma thompson, daughter of phyllida law) as miss bates; what this version needs is a scene where emma reconciles with miss bates, as she is the character to whose fate we are drawn. the film is worth watching (again even) for her performance alone.<br /><br />all in all, this has aged wonderfully with charm to spare and more than enough subtlety to sort out the british class system. well worth a rental (because its unlikely that paltrow will ever be this good again--but we'll always have emma).	0
romance is in the air and love is in bloom in victorian era england, in this light-hearted story set against a society in a time in which manners were still in vogue, the ladies were charming and elegant, and the gentlemen dashing. `emma,' based on the novel by jane austen and written for the screen and directed by douglas mcgrath, stars the lovely gwyneth paltrow in the title role. a self-appointed matchmaker, emma takes great delight in the romantic notion of playing cupid and attempting to pair up those she feels are suited to one another. coming off a successful matching that ended in marriage, she next sets her sights on finding a mate for her friend, harriet (toni collette), but the outcome of her initial attempt proves to be less than satisfying. meanwhile, her endeavors are tempered by by the handsome mr. knightley (jeremy northam), whose insights into matters of the heart often seem to be a bit more astute than emma's, and lend some needed balance to the proceedings. and emma, so concerned with what is right for others, neglects the heart that is actually the most important of all: her own. the world goes round and love abounds, but emma is about to miss the boat. luckily for her, however, the is someone just right for her waiting in the wings. now, if she can but stop long enough to realize it. but as everyone who has known true love knows, matters of the heart can go right or wrong in an instant, depending upon the slightest thing; and while romance is at hand for emma, she must first recognize it, and seize the moment.<br /><br /> mcgrath has crafted and delivered a delightful, feel-good film that is like a breath of fresh air in our often turbulent world. there may be an air of frivolity about it, but in retrospect, this story deals with something that is perhaps the most important thing there is-- in all honesty-- to just about anyone: love. and with mcgrath's impeccable sense of pace and timing, it all plays out here in a way that is entirely entertaining and enjoyable. it's a pleasant, affecting film, with a wonderful cast, that successfully transports the viewer to another time and another place. it's light fare, but absorbing; and the picturesque settings and proceedings offer a sense of well-being and calm that allows you to immerse yourself in it and simply go with the flow.<br /><br /> the winsome paltrow, who won the oscar for best actress for `shakespeare in love' two years after making this one, seems comfortable and right at home in this genre. she personifies all things british, and does it with such naturalness and facility that it's the kind of performance that is easily taken for granted or overlooked altogether. she's simply so good at what she does and makes it look so easy. she has a charismatic screen presence and an endearing manner, very reminiscent of audrey hepburn. yet paltrow is unique. as an actor, she has a wide range and style and has demonstrated-- with such films as `hard eight,' `hush' and `a perfect murder'-- that she can play just about any part effectively, and with that personal touch that makes any role she plays her own. but it's with characters like emma that she really shines. she is so expressive and open, and her personality is so engaging, that she is someone to whom it is easy to relate and just a joy to watch, regardless of the part she is playing. and for emma, she is absolutely perfect.<br /><br /> jeremy northam also acquits himself extremely well in the role of knightley, and like paltrow, seems suited to the genre-- in the right role, that is; his performance in the more recent `the golden bowl,' in which he played an italian prince, was less than satisfying. here, however, he is perfect; he is handsome, and carries himself in such a way that makes knightley believable and very real. like colin firth's mr. darcy in the miniseries `pride and prejudice,' northam has created a memorable character with his own mr. knightley.<br /><br /> also excellent in supporting roles and worthy of mention are toni collette, as emma's friend harriet smith; and alan cumming, as the reverend elton. respectively, collette and cumming create characters who are very real people, and as such become a vital asset to the overall success of this film. and it demonstrates just how invaluable the supporting players are in the world of the cinema, and to films of any genre.<br /><br /> the supporting cast includes greta scacchi (mrs. weston), denys hawthorne (mr. woodhouse), sophie thompson (miss bates), kathleen byron (mrs. goddard), phyllida law (mrs. bates), polly walker (jane fairfax) and ewan mcgregor (frank churchill). an uplifting, elegant film, `emma' is a reminder of civilized behavior and the value of gentleness and grace in a world too often beset with unpleasantness. and even if it's only through the magic of the silver screen, it's nice to be able to escape to such a world as this, if only for a couple of hours, as it fulfills the need for that renewal of faith in the human spirit. and that's the magic of the movies. i rate this one 9/10. <br /><br /> <br /><br />	0
this is one of the best films i have seen in years! i am not a gwyneth paltrow fan, but she is excellent as emma woodhouse. alan cumming is superb as reverand elton, and emma thompson's sister, sophie, is hysterical as miss bates. and check out the gorgeous jeremy northam as mr. knightley; what a gentleman! whoever said you need sex and violence in a movie to make it good has never seen emma. i think that is what separates it from so many others--it's classy.<br /><br />if you're looking for a film that you can watch with the whole family, or looking for a romance for yourself, look no further. emma is that movie. with a beautiful setting, wonderful costumes, and an outstanding cast (have i mentioned the gorgeous jeremy northam?), emma is a perfect ten!	0
i was so impressed with doug mcgrath's film version of the jane austen novel ""emma,"" and i loved the music score by rachel portman so much, that when i went to the video store one day and discovered the two had re-united for ""nicholas nickleby"" i immediately rented it without any other consideration.<br /><br />i have read the book, and for those overly-critical fans of this jane austen adaptation, i don't know what else mcgrath could have done to more perfectly capture the spirit and major plot elements of miss austen's work, especially given the limitations of a two hour movie (which some have complained about being too long!). and as far as gwen paltrow's accent is concerned, i must confess i wasn't too familiar with her when i saw this at the theater initially, and i was absolutely convinced at the time that she was an english actress!<br /><br />i am taken aback by those who criticized the film for its lush scenery. that is one of the things i enjoy and look forward to seeing in period pieces set in the english countryside. the film's beautiful backgrounds are a major contributor to its appeal and success. if your idea of escapist fare is something bleaker, then perhaps you should rent something like ""death wish iii!""<br /><br />the english country settings are as attractive and charming as the cast, and combine with the story and soundtrack for entertainment that makes you not tire of repeat viewings. mcgrath is a wonder at choreographing the interplay of subtle expressions that are so essential in conveying the complicated romantic intrigue that occurs in this story.<br /><br />this refreshing movie could also be a clinic on how enjoyable a film can be minus sex, violence or even a villainous antagonist. the story is often amusing, endearing, and at times, quite touching.<br /><br />i have seen many competent jane austen book adaptations but this is without question my favorite.	0
by no means my favourite austen novel, and paltrow is by no means my favourite actress, but i found the film almost totally delightful. paltrow does a good job, and cummings, stevenson and the one who plays 'miss bates' are all absolutely terrific. the period detail is not alienating; the feel of the movie is just right, in fact. but the real 'find' is jeremy northam as mr knightley. there could not be more perfect casting, imo. i hated mr k in the novel, but found him wonderfully human and humane in the film. northam's good looks and smiling eyes are no hindrance to enjoyment, either! highly recommended. anar	0
a remarkable documentary about the landmark achievements of the women lawyers association (wla) of kumba, in southwest cameroon, in legally safeguarding the rights of women and children from acts of domestic violence. in this muslim culture, where men have always been sovereign over women, according to sharia law, one can well imagine the difficulty of imposing secular legal rights for women and children. after 17 years of failed efforts, leaders of the wla began recently to score a few wins, and the purpose of this film is to share these victorious stories.<br /><br />the leaders of this legal reform movement are vera ngassa, a state prosecutor, and beatrice ntuba, a senior judge (court president). both play themselves in this film, which may contain footage shot spontaneously, though i imagine much of it, if not all, consists of subsequent recreations of real events for the camera. four cases are reviewed, and all of the plaintiffs also play themselves in the film.<br /><br />two cases involve repeated wife beating, with forcible sex in one case; another involves forced sex upon a 10 year old girl; and yet another concerns the repeated beatings of a child, age 8, by an aunt. one of the beaten wives also is seeking a divorce. we follow the cases from the investigation of complaints to the outcomes of the trials. the outcomes in each case are favorable to the women and children. the perpetrators receive stiff prison terms and/or fines; the divorce is granted.<br /><br />the aggressive prosecution of the child beating aunt demonstrates that these female criminal justice officials are indeed gender-neutral when it comes to enforcing the law. also noteworthy is the respect with which all parties, including those found guilty, are treated. this is a highly important and well made film. (of interest is the fact that one of the directors, ms. longinotto, also co-directed the 1998 film, divorce, iranian style, which dealt with related themes in tehran.) (in broken english with english subtitles). my grade: b+ 8/10	0
what a delightful film...<br /><br />accompanied by oscar-winning composer rachel portman's lush, emotional and dreamy music, this film remains a pure delight worthy of viewing more than once a year.<br /><br />incredible casting...<br /><br />gwyneth paltrow was perfect for the role of emma. toni collette was great as harriett smith.<br /><br />the character who stole the film was miss bates!!! she was mesmerizing to watch, one finds oneself on the edge of ones' seat just hanging on her every word and laughing hysterically with her. one of the most endearing characters i have come across in ages. from one of the opening scenes when she is thanking mr. woodhouse for sending ""that lovely quarter-hind of pork... pork, mother!!!"" she shouts into her daffy and clearly hearing impaired mother, mrs. bates (played by emma thompson's mother, phyllida law) who looks forlorn and lost.<br /><br />the comical ways that emma would avoid the grating miss bates builds itself up for one truly gut-wrenching scene at the picnic when emma insults miss bates who takes her cruel dig to her heart. we then see poor miss bates stammering and on the verge of tears and just so crushed one can not help but feel one's heart ripped out to her on her behalf. it is a classic scene, one to be rewound and played over & over...<br /><br />the ending is right up there with ""sense & sensibility"" and provides one of life's greatest lessons about how one should marry one's best friend...<br /><br />i hope that this film delights you all as much as it has myself.<br /><br />i adored it!	0
i love this movie. my friend marcus and i were browsing the local hastings because we had an urge to rent something we had never seen before and stumbled across this fine film. we had no idea what it was going to be about, but it turned out spectacular. 2 thumbs up. i liked how the film was shot, and the actors were very funny. if you are are looking for a funny movie that also makes you think i highly suggest you quickly run to your local video store and find this movie. i would tell you some of my favorite parts but that might ruin the film for you so i won't. this movie is definitely on my top 10 list of good movies. do you really think nothing is bouncy?	0
make the world go away. get it off my shoulder. say the things you used to say, and make the world go away.<br /><br />well, dave (david hewlett) and andrew (andrew miller) were in a pickle, one for embezzlement, and the other for kissing a child. neither was guilty, but faced with charges and their house about to be torn down, they ended up in, well, nothing. the whole world, except for their house went away.<br /><br />it is kind of weird, but funny, too. just what would you do if you were all alone in the world? the two friends just enjoy each other's company, and do what they want. but, that gets old fast, it seems.<br /><br />then they start to improve their live by hating away memories. the sound effects during this were great.<br /><br />things really got weird at the end. this film was the product of a great imagination, and written and directed by vincenzo natali, with help from the two stars. it just has to be seen.	0
i totally agree that ""nothing"" is a fantastic film! i've not laughed so much when watching a film for ages! and david hewlett and andrew miller are fantastic in this! they really work well together! this film may not appeal to some people (i can't really say why without spoiling it!) but each to their own! i loved it and highly recommend it!<br /><br />the directing is great and some of the shots are very clever. it looks as though they may have had a lot of fun when filming it!<br /><br />although there are really only main 2 characters in the film and not an awful lot of props the actors manage to pull it off and make the film enjoyable to watch.	0
the only word that sums up this movie is quirky. it's a light-hearted romp through an existential concept. bouncy (in more way than one) and a bit nutty. i wouldn't exactly call it grand and unforgettable cinema and it doesn't seem quite as memorable as the director's first movie ""cube"" but it's a good pit of fluff to watch on a sunday morning. the acting veers from respectable to annoying at times but i believe that's how it was to be written. done as a serious movie it could perhaps have been great or may very well have stepped into a state of pretension. a little like ""the matrix"" meets ""head"" meets ""human nature"".<br /><br />6.8 out of ten	0
yes...i'm going with the 1-0 on this and here's why. in the last few years, i have watched quite a few comedies and only left with a few mild laughs and a couple video rental late fees because the movies were that easy to forget. then i stumble upon ""nothing"". looked interesting, wasn't expecting much though. i was wrong. this was probably one of the funniest movies i have ever had the chance to watch. dave and andrew make a great comedic pair and the humor was catchy enough to remember, but not over complex to the point of missing the joke. i don't want to remark on any of the actual scenes, because i do feel this is a movie worth seeing for once. with more and more pointless concepts coming into movies (you know, like killer military jets and ""fresh"" remakes that are ruining old classics), this movie will make you happy to say it's ok to laugh at ""nothing"".	0
this movie was very funny, i couldn't stop smiling when watching this and have already watched it twice in a period of 2 days! the movie is distinctively unique in it's humor and visuals, both are terrific and on par with natali's other (more serious) movie gems cube and cypher. i have become a huge vincenzo natali fan ever since watching cypher and everything he's made is very interesting.<br /><br />very likable about this movie are the music and ""loser"" characters dave and andrew, portrayed by david hewlett and andrew miller (co-writer of the story), actors i both like very much. also cool are the x-box dead or alive fights (you even see dave playing halo at a point) and andrew's amazing guitar solo, among many other things.<br /><br />all in all a great feel-good film about friendship. you have to see this!	0
i work at a movie store, and as such, i am always on the look-out for an excellent movie. i decided to check out nothing as it sat in our canadian section, and i've been trying to support my country's movie industry. i was in for a surprise. the film features david hewlett and andrew miller in a highly entertaining story that seems to delve into so much of our minds and relationships...without working that hard. it is consistently comedic through the interaction of the two characters, as well as some funny exchanges (""we can't be dead, we have cable!""). what more can i say without noting that it is worth a shot, even if you abandon it within the first half an hour.	0
this is a good movie, but it is not recommended if you don't like intelligent movies. it's about two guys that wish that the world would go away,and that's exactly what they get. the acting is great, the ending was not predictable,and it actually had a good story unlike most movies these days. people complain about the movie being too simple or too boring. i think they should just stick to movies like the toxic avenger (i actually like b movies) or the grim adventures of billy and mandy. one note: if you notice this, this has exactly the same actors from cube except four actors. make it two notes: wait after the credits (trust me on this one). enjoy the movie.	0
sisters in law is made by the same directors of the rather curiously fascinating 'divorce, iranian style' which was as exactly as it stated, as we got a glimpse of divorce court in iran. now they've turned their attention to the court system in cameroon, africa. what's great about this court is that 2 of the magistrates are women, which is unusual for such a country like this. anyways, they deal with plenty of men used to getting their way around the women, but this film is remarkable in the fact that it appears that women has made great strides in society, with divorce legal and women's rights being recognized. so the judges often chastise the men for behaving in a primitive way in these times. not to say that the women who appear at the court get the softer treatment. one of the prime focuses of the film is a case of child abuse done by an aunt. the judges waste no time in lashing out at the woman with fury. and who said that justice isn't served anymore? with these 2 behind the bench. they often carry out maximum penalties! ya! you go girl!	0
i can only agree with taximeter that this is a fantastic film and should be seen by a wide audience. the imagination on display, the visual interpretation of the script, the humor is constantly surprising. the two leads are great and really carry the film. my advice would be to not even watch a trailer, just rent the film and watch without expectations. i rented from blockbuster, so it is readily available in brisbane, not everyone will enjoy it but i think most people will have an opinion and that's always good, unless it's just 'that was stupid'. i loved this film, you just don't get to see gem's like this every day. this should become a cult favorite. give it a try, you may just feel the same way about it as i do.	0
i thought this was an awesome movie. the theme song is sweet! :) anyway, the only thing that somewhat bothered me was in the beginning, when everything should have been normal. it was very weird and unrealistic. the big cable company is mainly what i'm talking about. apart from that, the movie was very creative. i think that all the acting was well done, the actors acted out their characters' personalities perfectly. everything fit together well. it really is a shame that their isn't a soundtrack. that would have been great! because this is a canadian film, and because it is one of my favorites, i give this movie a 10 out of 10!	0
tweaked a little bit, 'nothing' could be a children's film. it's a very clever concept, touches upon some interesting metaphysical themes, and goes against pretty much every hollywood convention you can think of...what goes against everything more than, literally, ""nothing""? nothing is the story of two friends who wish the world away when everything goes wrong with their lives. all that's left is what they don't hate, and a big empty white space. it's hard to focus a story on just two actors for the majority of your film, especially without any cuts to anything going on outside the plot. it focuses on pretty much one subject, but that's prime vincenzo natali territory. if you've seen 'cube', you know already that he tends to like that type of situation. the ""nothing"" in this movie is apparently infinite space, but natali somehow manages to make it somewhat claustrophobic, if only because there's literally nothing else, and nowhere else to go. the actors sell it, although you can tell these guys are friends anyway. two actors from 'cube' return here (worth and kazan), but are entirely different characters. they change throughout the story, and while they're not the strongest actors in the world, they're at least believable.<br /><br />the reason i say this could be a children's film under the right tweaks, is because aside from a few f-bombs and a somewhat unnecessary bloody dream sequence, the whimsical and often silly feel of this movie could very much be digested easily by kids. so i find it an odd choice that the writers decided to add some crass language and a small amount of gore, especially considering there isn't very much of it. this could've gotten a pg rating easily had they simply cut a few things out and changed a little dialogue. there is very little objectionable about this film, but just enough to keep parents from wanting their kids to see it. i only say that's a shame because not because i support censorship, but because that may have been the only thing preventing this movie from having wider exposure.<br /><br />at any rate, this is a reasonably entertaining film, albeit with a few dragged-out scenes. but for literally being about nothing, and focused entirely on two characters and their interactions with absolutely nothing, they do a surprisingly good job for an independent film.	0
a light-hearted comedy, nothing shows us a world that we sometimes wish to escape to: a world of nothing. anything you don't like, be it a stack of bills, a bad memory, or even hunger can disappear at your wish. they approached this movie very well, and with an enjoyable starring duo, there were only a few things i didn't like about nothing, and they weren't even part of the main movie.<br /><br />first, the post-credits scene (and yes, there is one): good for a chuckle, but what were they trying to accomplish with that? i was confused and eager to see a return to something after a whole movie of nothing. instead, we just hear a random assortment of noises and they scream. it tries to set up a sequel in my opinion, and wasn't really necessary, nor was it funny after the turtle crawled out of frame.<br /><br />second, the trailer: i saw the trailer on the dvd, and like others have already said this, it promotes a horror movie that never came. oh well, poor marketing i guess.<br /><br />if you see this at your movie rental store, take a look, because nothing is a great movie to watch. if you have a big screen though, you might want to wear shades.	0
well, ""cube"" (1997), vincenzo's first movie, was one of the most interesting and tricky ideas that i've ever seen when talking about movies. they had just one scenery, a bunch of actors and a plot. so, what made it so special were all the effective direction, great dialogs and a bizarre condition that characters had to deal like rats in a labyrinth. his second movie, ""cypher"" (2002), was all about its story, but it wasn't so good as ""cube"" but here are the characters being tested like rats again.<br /><br />""nothing"" is something very interesting and gets vincenzo coming back to his 'cube days', locking the characters once again in a very different space with no time once more playing with the characters like playing with rats in an experience room. but instead of a thriller sci-fi (even some of the promotional teasers and trailers erroneous seemed like that), ""nothing"" is a loose and light comedy that for sure can be called a modern satire about our society and also about the intolerant world we're living. once again vicenzo amaze us with a great idea into a so small kind of thing. 2 actors and a blinding white scenario, that's all you got most part of time and you don't need more than that. while ""cube"" is a claustrophobic experience and ""cypher"" confusing, ""nothing"" is completely the opposite but at the same time also desperate.<br /><br />this movie proves once again that a smart idea means much more than just a millionaire budget. of course that the movie fails sometimes, but its prime idea means a lot and offsets any flaws. there's nothing more to be said about this movie because everything is a brilliant surprise and a totally different experience that i had in movies since ""cube"".	0
having seen cube, i've been a fan of vincenzo natali's work. natali seems to have this inept ability to take a storyline, and hardly wring it our like a wet towel for all the storyline he can muster. instead, he lets the stories themselves unfold in natural ways, so much in fact, that you may in fact believe there is this cube were people try to escape, or in the case of nothing, a large empty expanse where there is... nothing! the advert had me hooked instantly. it seemed so simple! take two characters who no one likes, and send them to a world where there is nothing. natali does this so simply that you forget the logic that a place where there is nothing cannot exist. in fact, the world of nothing becomes something of an irony within the film. there's nothing there, but also 'something' there.<br /><br />it might be a good time to point out that the trailer is highly misleading. i was fortunate enough to actually understand that the film leaned to a more comedic side than the trailer otherwise told so. therefore upon watching the film, i laughed every now and again, whereas someone who the advert mislead may find themselves utterly confused.<br /><br />if i may take a minute to give the film some praise, where the film excels on is the concept. it is a genius concept to have a world of nothing, and to put two characters there, not two brilliant minded characters, who will philosophise and work out their surroundings, but two idiots who have absolutely no clue as to where the hell they are! another strong point is the film's cinematography, though at first this may not seem it! where each wall, north, earth, south, west, up and down is just a white plane, a perception of depth becomes faulty. it is hard to determine where things are placed in the mis-en-scene. the cinematography has many moments where this actually happens, but for the most part, the camera is placed so that two characters, or an object and a character are placed in the foreground and background, allowing a sense of depth to be realised.<br /><br />however, this film does lack in certain areas. the film is relatively short, but even so, after a while the novelty of this world of nothing becomes rather dull, and you wish to find some form of resolution within the plot. we can also argue that the acting is once again, questionable. these two characters are in a sense, unlikeable, therefore we feel no sympathy at any point for these characters. however, on a flip side of that, the chemistry and friendship between the two characters seems real enough, but there is something lacking.<br /><br />even so, i do rank this as a thoroughly enjoyable film! do not let the trailer fool you into thinking this is another science-fiction horror film. it is much more of a comedy than that! it is indeed worth watching though, purely for the concept itself!	0
i chanced upon this movie because i had a free non-new release from blockbuster and needed to grab something quickly, as the store was getting ready to close for the evening. the plain white cover and title intrigued me. i'm a (relatively speaking) ""old"" lady and my son is a young man of 30. i adore movies that are sheer entertainment, such as the sixth sense, interview with a vampire, harry potter and beetlejuice. my son, on the other hand, is a film graduate and enjoys very specialized foreign films, such as those directed by bergman or hertzog. we generally hate each other's movie choices, however, we both watched and loved the movie nothing! it was unlike any movie we'd ever seen before. we're both cynical/critical personality types and we usually crack on movies while we watch them -- but in this case we just laughed and enjoyed the film from start to finish. it is our opinion that if this movie had been promoted and shown in the main stream theaters in the u.s. it would have done very well indeed.	0
i watched the trailer on the dvd after seeing the film, and i think anyone who saw it before watching the film would be very surprised and possibly disappointed. it made much of the fact that the film was ""by the director of cube"" and made it look like a horror film, when in fact it is an absurdist comedy (imdb's spell checker doesn't seem to think that absurdist is a word, but it is), reminiscent of rosencrantz and guildernstern are dead.<br /><br />i love the way the story builds up slowly at first, then gradually escalates. i also enjoy the fact that no explanation is given for what happens in the film. that and the fact that the story plays out mainly in just the one set are the only respects in which this film is similar to cube. i recommend it.	0
director vincenzo natali first showed his penchant for character-based sci-fi flicks with his 1997 short film ""elevated"", wherein 3 people remain trapped in an elevator while unseen monsters roam the building. his follow-up feature project ""cube"", released later that year, had a very similar premise, this time with 6 people and instead of an elevator it was a vast expansion of interlocking cubic deathtraps. both were admirable attempts to take the sci-fi genre a step further, by deliberately declining to show almost any visual stimulation, choosing instead to spend as much time as possible focusing on the human element, how the characters act, react and interact under incomprehensible and dangerous conditions. after his exploration into the mainstream with 2002's ""cypher"", natali has come back to his bizarre character-film trend to bring us ""nothing"", his latest, and by far most optimistic and comedic take on the wide cinematic world of ""what if?""<br /><br />dave (david hewlett) and andrew (andrew miller) are life-long friends, brought together by a mutual detachment from society and a lack of any one else to be with. dave, who has always been hindered by a selfish and somewhat dimwitted nature, lives rent-free with andrew at his ill-located and ill-constructed house, where he often takes advantage of andrew's neurotic and antisocial mentality. despite all this, the two misfits are happy together, until one day their deep character flaws, coupled with some astronomically bad luck, land them in the middle of some pretty serious, jail-sentence-worthy trouble. on top of this, they discover that their house has been deemed unfit for existence and is scheduled to be demolished before sunset, so in the hazy, nightmarish panic of everything going wrong for them, they wish that the whole world would just disappear. and it does.<br /><br />going any further with the synopsis would compromise a lot of the film's slow (occasionally too slow) reveal about what's happened to dave and andrew, and how they deal with their new reality. natali's fascination with studying human behavior under duress (ala the birds) is here in spades, but simply by making the main characters friends rather than strangers, he's able to break away from the thriller-horror element of this premise to open it up to a more comfortable and optimistic level. it's almost as if he's made the aphoristic opposite of ""cube"".<br /><br />of course, the film is not 85 minutes of laughter and sunshine. in keeping with fundamental realism, our two anti-heroes' dynamic often becomes antagonistic, sometimes with rather nasty results. like the ""desert island"" game, the film looks at how even best friends, when left alone together, can fall apart, but at the same time it shows that friends are vital to the quality of existence. in a very twisted, sci-fi way, this is a feel-good flick, with good heart and good intentions.<br /><br />however, there are a few qualms to be had with ""nothing"". while the two lead actors, hewlett and miller, do well with their parts, their characters are not nearly as interesting as they should have been, considering it is completely up to them to entertain us for the better part of an hour. there is some development in the relationship and personalities of dave and andrew, some background is given, but ultimately not enough. a generous viewer will sit through the less-engaging portions of the film to see it through to the end, but cynics will probably give up pretty fast.<br /><br />acting, as mentioned, is adequate, and considering the amount of 'green-screen' work that would've been needed, reasonably convincing. david hewlett and andrew miller, who both wrote co-wrote the screenplay, have been long-time friends of vincenzo natali: hewlett has in fact featured in every film natali has made. perhaps it was their creative input that steered this film in a more positive direction. nonetheless, the story could have been a lot more involving. granted, it is relatively entertaining considering that (no pun intended) nothing really happens, but you get the impression that, in more experienced hands, a lot more could've been done with this premise.<br /><br />in all fairness, ""nothing"" is an impressive piece of work in many ways. the concept is interesting, the direction is inventive, the script works on a human level and, most of all, it shows a progression in natali's creative mentality. for fans of his work, this will be a delight, and for others it will be a nice way to pass a little unwanted time. it's just a shame that the director's fixation on human drama prevented it from being the great, fun film it could have been.	0
i just saw this at the toronto film festival, and i hope it gets wide release because i want to see it again! it is a character-driven film, and andrew and david are more than up to the task. any discussion of the plot might be<br /><br />considered spoilers, so i'll just say that the storyline is clever, the acting is superb, and the effects are amazing. well-filmed and well-paced too. one of the best films i have seen in ages, and very refreshing in this summer of dreary<br /><br />movies. it had the audience laughing the whole time. see it if you can. (i particularly liked the ""candy bar! candy bar!"" scene.)	0
if you want mindless action, hot chicks and a post-apocalyptic view of seattle, then this is the show for you!<br /><br />the concept of dark angel isn't anything new (in fact, there's controversy over whether james cameron stole the idea from a book), but i spend the entire hour watching it every tuesday from start to finish.<br /><br />jessica alba is smoking and max' friends (original cindy, kendra) are just as hot. <br /><br />the fight scenes are getting better, but the dialogues between original cindy and max need to be a little bit better (the slang sounds forced and it sounds like someone living in the suburbs wrote it).<br /><br />in my opinion, dark angel is a great guilty pleasure filled with everything an action fan could ask for, but if you're looking for hard hitting, award-winning drama, go watch ""the west wing"" or something.	0
i watched this as part of my course at aberystwyth university and it baffles me how this does not have a distributor in the uk. well actually, it doesn't, because this film is everything a hollywood film isn't - original, creative, quirky and humorous. it seems that today no-one really wants to see this type of movie as, in the simplest terms, it doesn't conform to the generic conventions most young viewers look for in a film.<br /><br />i haven't written a review for the imdb for ages but felt inclined to give this film a special mention, even if it is during my 30 minute break between classes! essentially, it is about nothing, as the two main characters are plunged into their own world of nothingness through a hate of the world. the brilliance here is how the director sustains interest through the majority of the run time with only two characters and when the only mise-en-scene consists of half a house and a vast white, empty space. this is due in large part to the stellar performances of the actors, both of whom offer some great laughs while at the same time being able to add significant emotional depth to their roles.<br /><br />i'd love to write some more but am on quite a time limit. however i encourage anyone and everyone to give this film a try. a very unique concept is brought to the screen in a coherent and well-executed fashion, with the combination of good performances, a strong script, nice sound design and (fairly) impressive visuals creating a very entertaining movie.<br /><br />it's just a shame so few people know about nothing....	0
nothing is fantastic! simple as that! it's a film that shouldn't work, yet does. natali stays in the realm of sci-fi, however this film is also a comedy. cypher it seemed was a big budget draining affair for natali (at $7.5million! woo-hoo pa!) so with nothing he scales down again. this is low budget, independent film-making at it's best. simple, good old fashioned storytelling and an attempt at making a film for artistic merit as apposed to hollywood's usual reasons for mostly financial gain. nothing is a film about nothing and before you ask, no it is not anything like seinfeld! basically andrew and dave are a couple of losers. they live in a strange looking house beneath two freeways. andrew is a telesales travel agent who is agoraphobic while dave is andrews best mate who stays with him rent free to help him out. dave is tired of it however and has a gorgeous girlfriend who he wants to move in with. by bizarre mis-fortunes however, dave finds out his girlfriend embezzled a huge amount of money from daves work-place incriminating dave, and andrew is wrongly accused of sexually assaulting a girl scout (canadian humour people!). as it turns out andrew's house is to be demolished as well and he can't stop it happening as the house was built on land it should not have been built on. both andrew and dave are inside the house when the police and the demolition team come calling. they are desperate and can't escape, and in the panic and confusion just as the police burst in everything fades to white. what has happened? have dave and andrew died? they wake to find themselves still in the house only it is quiet. no police, no demolition team, no angry girl scout mother! what happens is dave and andy discover they have the ability to ""wish or hate away."" as it turns out they have hated away the entire outside world. they are left alone. the house is surrounded by nothing, which is portrayed as pure white. so what this means is that the films setting is a house set and then just white. the film is an interesting view on human isolation and the psyche and of course as they spend more time alone together with no food and no water, they begin to tire of each other. they discover they can hate away hunger, which is useful but obviously things get out of hand shall we say. i can't reveal much but i must say bouncing heads are quite a sight to behold.<br /><br />this film is quirky, funny, interesting. the effects are simple yet effective and natali brings together two buddies from cube, david hewlett, and andrew millar to lead the film. they have chemistry and also work very well. they have to hold 90% of the movie by themselves and much of it in a pure white background, yet it works. certainly i expect this to get the same diabolical treatment as cypher did and it should appear on dvd in a year or two in the states. nothing is a top quality and unique film and although not as good as cube or cypher it once again proves natali as one of the best up and comers.<br /><br />natali is someone who has really interested me in his three features so far and i cannot wait for his next feature. i prey to god he doesn't do the proposed necropolis, written and directed by add sufferer, the ever crap paul anderson. vincenzo old buddy if paul comes round to your pad, run!!! run like the wind!! i hope and prey this guy doesn't take to hollywood like alex proyas did (with the enjoyable yet pussy-footed, sugar coated, helium light: i robot!). keep your eyes peeled for this guy. ****	0
... than this ;-) what would happen if terry gilliam and douglas adams would have worked together on one movie? this movie starts with a touch of brazil... when, at a certain point, the story moves straight into the twilight zone... bringing up nothing new, but just nothing... and nothing is great fun! when dave and andrew starts to explore their new environment the movie gets really enjoyable... bouncing heads? well... yes ;-) <br /><br />anyway... this movie was, imho, the biggest surprise at this year's fantasyfilmfest...<br /><br />just like in cube and cypher natali gave this one a minimalistic, weird but very special design, which makes it hard to locate the place of the story or its time... timeless somehow...	0
nothing (3+ outta 5 stars) another weird premise from the director of the movie ""cube"". this time around there are two main characters who find themselves and their home transported to a mysterious white void. there is literally nothing outside of their small two-story house. intriguing to be sure, but i thought the comedic tone established for this movie from the get-go was extremely ill-conceived. there needs to be some humour, certainly... and i have no problem with the humour that was eventually derived from the plight of our two heroes (their final ""showdown"" was definitely a hoot)... but i really think the movie would have been a lot better off if it had stayed more rooted in reality in the beginning. after watching the movie i watched the ""making of"" feature on the dvd and a short trailer at the end is almost totally devoid of the ""sillier"" comedic aspects... making it look like a completely different (and slightly better) movie. the last half hour of the movie is where things really start to come together... similar in a way to the recent movie ""primer."" the actors are fine when they are not overdoing the comedy shtick. they are really quite believable in their more ""normal"" moments. i was probably ready to write this movie off as a failed experiment at the midway point... but it won me over by the end. (and keep watching past the credits for the final scene... just don't ask me to explain it.)	0
the premise of this movie has been tickling my imagination for quite some time now. we've all heard or read about it in some kind of con-text. what would you do if you were all alone in the world? what would you do if the entire world suddenly disappeared in front of your eyes? in fact, the last part is actually what happens to dave and andrew, two room-mates living in a run-down house in the middle of a freeway system. andrew is a nervous wreck to say the least and dave is considered being one of the biggest losers of society. that alone is the main reason to why these two guys get so well along, because they simply only have each other to turn to when comforting is needed. just until...<br /><br />straight from the beginning of the film lots and lots of problems happen to them. both of them get involved with crime, andrew suffers from paranoia and simply doesn't dare going out of the house. dave is unsuccessful at his job and his colleagues don't treat him very well and with the respect he deserves. the amount of problems they face keeps increasing until that one day where they may have to face the inevitable and deal with it. this is just too much for them and they wish that everything would just go away... and of course that is exactly what happens.<br /><br />the rest of the story places dave and andrew in this world of nothingness. at first they are surprised and have problems understanding and dealing with the features of this crazy environment, but later on they find out that they can do just about everything they want because it seems as if they are the only ones still left.<br /><br />nothing features an incredibly small cast - in fact, besides the first couple of shots from the film, we only see dave (david hewlett) and andrew (andrew miller) in the entire film. it is clear that in order to pull this off, the cast has to be more than up for the task, because in a world where nothing exists there is nothing that can distract the viewer in any way. vincenzo has decided to use a reasonable amount of close-up head shots to make it more interesting and it actually works quite well. director of photography, derek rogers, also has a nice way of teasing the audience by withholding visual information, especially at times where a character sees something and reacts to it, but we don't see it right away.<br /><br />obviously, this can't be an event driven film and it's not. much of the action happens outside their house when they move around in the void. and that's where some of the most hilarious scenes take place, especially in the case of when andrew discovers a candy bar.<br /><br />now, one could be thinking: ""how does nothing look like?"" well, it looks like nothing indeed. the entire world of nothing is white... white no matter in what direction you look. this is the weakness of this film... after an hour or less it's getting extremely boring to look at and there has to be events to make sure it's more interesting to look at. thank god, there are some. for example at times when the two lads, due to the properties of nothing, are able to jump really high as if nothing is made out of... tofu (as andrew claims). it's fun to see how they are instantly able to use nothing to become gods of their own little society.<br /><br />one of the best parts of the film is the set... production designer jasna stefanovic has done a beautiful job in this film, the house in which these two guys live is so unnaturally fun to look at, still it seems right for these two to be living in a place like this. all in all, the production design is with no doubt one of the most powerful aspects of this film at it really makes the film worth watching...<br /><br />however, the very best part of the film is the acting. both david hewlett and andrew miller really look like the professional actors they both are. the camera is on them for every second of the film and as previously said, there are just about no props in the film, they are really on a bare stage. with plenty of character development and some decent one-liners, clever dialogue (at times hilariously stupid), it all works to that end - and this really moves the movie away from the low-budget area to well-crafted handwork.<br /><br />let's talk a little about the visual effects, because they are definitely worth mentioning. nothing features digital visual effects and prosthetics that equals any modern horror film. there's a rather horrifying dream sequence in the film, and although the drews have milked that scene completely it's still fun to watch. one of the best visual effects in the film is at the end where andrew and dave suddenly discover their powers in this environment - they have the abilities to wish everything away, so what if they can do it the other "	0
i think this show is definitely the greatest show. jessica alba does such a great job in it. michael weatherly also does an awesome job, as well as the rest of the cast. the show is very intriguing and they have wonderful storylines and their stunts are amazing. it's like watching a 1-hour movie. it's definitely worth watching.	0
"i think it unfortunate that the leading comments on this movie include the words ""clueless and appalling nonsense."" i think it is a very funny movie and excellent entertainment. one has to suspend one's disbelief that a homosexual man and a lesbian woman could fall in love, have a child and live together happily ever after. but it is always wonderful to see it played out in a movie and have one's heart warmed. is it so impossible? there are far more implausible events described in other movies. the acting is good, the script is funny. the only negative comment is that the story could well have ended when the family drives away from its initial house instead of extending on to explore whether the man retains any residual homosexuality."	0
this film was seen by my wife and i when it came out in 1978. it was a revelation to us. we actually thought that we were the only gay and lesbian couple who had ever married and had children. obviously we were wrong. love may come from where you don't expect it and maybe don't want it. but we both chose that love anyway.<br /><br />and no, it never changed our sexual orientation. that kind of stuff is for the christian wackos.<br /><br />when we were young we both had affairs, but never with the opposite sex. as we aged we stopped having extramarital affairs.<br /><br />this story is not far fetched. however, the suggestion that they became heterosexuals seems pretty unrealistic to me. my wife and i have been sleeping together for the last 40 years. we are still gay. end of story.	0
"this is a film for entertainment; i did not think the world made social commentary from one small film. i personally find this film funny, audacious, and memorable. it is a fantasy not unlike a cinder girl becoming a princess. this film was done very well i might add, in the 70's a time of the best experiments in film with being able to mention a person's sexuality. this movie is not about a person being homosexual or not, it is however about love, in all it's strange forms. this film does show some of the realities of being gay in the 70's in hollywood, or in california. pretty boys being looked after by older not so pretty men. women who had to stay deeply locked in the emotional closet or risk not having a career. bathhouses were an integral part of the gay community.<br /><br />then the fantasy begins!! let us mix a lesbian with a gay and add some liquor and what do we have? well this movie, which in any way was better than that dismal redo ""the next big thing"". perhaps someone should have asked the entire crew to see this movie and then try to do better.<br /><br />i enjoyed this movie when i saw it in the 70's and it still brings a smile to my lips now. i heartily advise anyone who wants a funny, tender movie- to curl up with some popcorn and have some fun. some people need to lighten up!!! and this is the film you should do it with!<br /><br />"	0
this movie is as unique as it is overlooked......a different story is just that, it shows how out of the need to survive or maintain, one can find the capacity to love if you have an open heart as well as an open mind. i first saw this on cable in the late 70's and it truly depicted the limitations of the gay community at the time. i believe this movie was ahead of its time in depicting a little slice of an obscure way of life. it is truly a classic in the sense that it was a precursor to what is now depicted as the extended family. this film should be available on dvd/vhs so that not only the extra ordinary performances of meg foster & perry king can be acknowledged, but to show how far we have come & still have to go where relationships are concerned.	0
"in order to stop her homosexual friend albert (perry king) from being deported back to belgium, stella (meg foster) decides to marry him. the only other problem with that is that stella herself is a lesbian. the two have their separate lives when one night after albert's birthday party, they fall into bed and then into love. later in the film after falling in love, stella suspects albert of cheating and shows up at his job one night late after closing. what she finds will leave the viewer stunned. this is a great film, very original. perry king and meg foster are so good in their roles that it is amazing that they were not better recognized for their work here. very controversial upon its release in 1978, the ""r"" rated film is now ""pg"" in this much more liberal time.<br /><br />recently released on dvd, the disc contains a ""making of"" segment on the special features and in it it's stated that the film was based on an actual story so the viewers who say the film is not ""real"" are mistaken. everyone is an individual and different people fall in love for different reasons-these are the issues explored in this wonderful film for everyone who has ever loved!"	0
i appreciated the photography, the textures, the colours and often, unlike one comment, the lighting. what was lacking for me was a coherent storyline.i found it often disjointed, badly edited and at times difficult to follow. my version was 110 minutes, imdb shows one at 125m. possibly the cuts and subtitles didn't help. i applaud any films that escape from the hollywood mould but this left me disappointed. miss gillain was luminous and the performances were all fine, i just wanted a little more dialogue. if anyone would like to see another film that has some affinity with this one, try 'hideous kinky'with kate winslet.	0
this story is a complex and wonderful tale of the last harem of the ottoman empire, well told and provoking we see the inner workings of a world now gone, and learn about the people who lived there.<br /><br />i enjoyed the story, characters, acting and scenes. a few scenes suffered from quick editing and the sub titles sometimes disappeared too quickly, otherwise a wonderful piece.<br /><br />the main character safiya is played wonderfully by marie gillain who i am pleased to say did a fantastic job without over doing it. the scenes with her and alex descas (nadir) are charming and lovely.<br /><br />i recommend this film for anybody looking to watch something less hollywood and more authentic to the world they are emulating.	0
the makers have chosen the best people for the job, and set the scene wonderfully. every interior is full of detail that tells you all about the people who live in it. whether the period is the 20s (the first story), the present (ie 1950) for the middle story, or the 1910s (the last), costumes and settings are lovingly observed and created. i love the fussy costumes of the two old ladies in the sanatorium - exquisite lace overlaid by the finest shetland shawls. roland culver as ashenden is very appealing, but never mind the soppy young lovers, it's raymond huntley as the man who resents his wife's health and independence who harrows our emotions. he usually played comical, pompous types, but here he is subtle and convincing and very impressive. the china seas (great 30s film starring gable and harlow) stole the plot from the mr know all episode (and also nicked a story by kipling). i wish we saw more of naunton wayne as the jealous husband - though he has a good moment looking melancholy in a mexican hat. i love that posh bird who plays his wife, too.	0
what was there about 1939 that helped produce so many excellent hollywood films? well, whatever it was, the magic may also be found in this columbia picture. it's a long forgotten screwball comedy that turner classic movies has begun to show. (maltin's movie book does not contain it.) in nearly every department, amazing mr. williams is a jewel.<br /><br />it's the story of a first-rate police detective who can never find the time to marry his intended. as the wedding bells are about to ring, he gets called to the scene of a murder. the lady in question has to learn the hard way not only to enjoy the pursuit of criminals but to belong to the police force. there are a lot of laughs in the process.<br /><br />melvyn douglas proved again that he had few peers in light comedy. joan blondell was at the peak of her career and is a delight. edward brophy and donald mcbride are hilarious.<br /><br />the film goes on a bit too long, but who cares? the screwball comedies are always able to entertain, and this film belongs right in there with the best.	0
"spoilers following: i picked up the book ""evil angels"" when it first came out knowing nothing of the case. just to give the press and the austrialian people a break here, i was quite far into it before i began to question the chamberlain's guilt. the author obviously intended the reader to understand why the public jumped to the conclusions they did. john bryson told the story just as it was presented to the jurors (and picked up by the press) of the arterial spray, the actelone (??) plates, dr. james cameron's certainty that the collar was cut with scissors, that a baby could not be taken whole from her clothes with the buttons still done up, bloody hand print, etc. all quite convincingly. after all, these were experts in their fields who were testifying with no apparent reason to lie, and the fact that the evidence was completely wrong wasn't apparent to me at all. it was also highly technical evidence, difficult for a layman to understand. to this point, beyond some hearsay testimony in the trials, hardly anyone had ever heard of a dingo attacking a human; people didn't believe it was possible. the public was suspicious of the seventh day adventists, whose origins made them appear to be a cult, and all sorts of wild beliefs about them contributed to the appearance of guilt. were it not for dedicated, selfless lawyers who worked relentlessly to investigate and counter the trial testimony, finding azaria's clothes later would not have been enough to get lindy out of jail. the book shook me for that reason, and i've been reluctant to come to a conclusion about anyone's guilt ever since (excepting oj of course). i was thrilled that a movie was going to be made about the case and don't think it could have been done better. i've always liked sam, who i could identify with completely, and meryl was perfect as always. beautiful photography, haunting music. i think it's not only a very good, but a very important, movie. too bad it didn't receive more publicity at the time it was released."	0
in 1976 i had just moved to the us from ceylon. i was 23, and had been married for a little over three years, and was beginning to come out as a lesbian. i saw this movie on an old black and white tv, with terrible reception, alone, and uninterrupted, in an awakening that seemed like an echo of the story. i was living in a small house in tucson arizona, and it was summertime... like everyone else here, i never forgot the feelings the images of this story called forth, and its residue of fragile magic, and i have treasured a hope that i would see it again someday. i'll keep checking in. i also wish that someone would make a movie of shirley verel's 'the other side of venus'. it also has some of the same delicacy and persistent poignancy...	0
although time has revealed how some of the effects were done this story of love and adventure still is special.<br /><br />if you've never seen this film before you'll be shocked at how much has been stolen by later film makers. i was watching this with a friend who was amazed at how much disney's aladdin cribbed from the film. they loved the movie and enjoyed that it was such a touchstone for so many other films and film makers.<br /><br />i've given the film an 8 out of 10 instead of a 10 out of ten, which is where a good portion of this film dwells, because in the final 15 minutes the film falls apart in the pacing. everything is rushed as if they has to suddenly get to the end. from the point from the departure of the djinn to the end it appears to be more sketch then finished painting. it doesn't kill the film, but it does weaken it.<br /><br />still its required viewing for anyone who loves a good fairy tale, or even a great movie.	0
"i first discovered alexander korda's (1940) fantasy, the thief of bagdad in the early 1950's on a re-issue billed as ""the wonder show of the century!"" both korda technicolor films, the thief of bagdad and jungle book were shown on one never to be forgotten program. the music of miklos rozsa enhanced both films. the technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful! the thief of bagdad has remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made. as the years passed, it became more difficult to enjoy the film's color in the way it had originally been presented in. true technicolor gave way to a eastman color process in the middle 1950's. both kino and samuel goldwyn reissued the film both theatrically and on video. but the eastman color prints were more pastel in nature and muted the vibrancy of the original technicolor. the laser disc release of this title also has the pastel look to it -- nice, but not as it should be. now comes the m-g-m dvd (3 dec 2002) issue. the thief of bagdad again has the wonderful technicolor look to it on a dvd that is nothing short of stunning!!! it was so exciting to see it like this once again that after viewing the dvd once, i watched it a second time. the only ""extras"" are a spanish dubbed version, sub-titles in both english & spanish, and a beautifully done original theatrical trailer. thank you m-g-m for this exceptional dvd release. now, one can only hope that korda's four feathers and a restored version of korda's jungle book (to replace to poor public domain prints in circulation) will soon follow on dvd."	0
"i'm not even sure what to say about this film. it's one of only a handful of movies ever made that i would consider romantic. to try to talk plot or performance or technical details about this film would be in the words of frank zappa ""like dancing about architecture"". it absolutely hits the nail right on the head in the way it captures those fleeting moments in life that move us and then run away from us never to be experienced again. this seems like the movie the character version of charlie kaufman in the movie adaptation wanted to write. the ending is left open and ambiguous, no happy ending here, just mystery. no profound life lessons, just a couple of horny and intelligent kids exploring the ability to feel the most irrational and unrealistic of feelings...... romantic love.<br /><br />10 out of 10 watch it with your special lady and recommend it to a stranger................"	0
i had never heard of this film before a couple of weeks ago, but its concept interested me when i heard it: an american man meets a european woman on his last night in europe and they spend the night together talking. it sparked my interest, but i never expected it to be this great. before sunrise is a masterpiece, and it's also one of the most romantic films on record. to my surprise, it completely lacked the cynicism of the 1990s. it's impossible to really talk too much about it, since there is no real plot, so to speak (although there are plenty of thoroughly interesting things you could talk about; it is sort of like my dinner with andre, where there is a conversation, but it's not just the conversation that matters), but let me just say, see it. see it!	0
that certain thing is the story of a gold digger (viola dana) from a tenement house. her mother uses her to take care of her two brothers, but they are a loving family. although dana's character has the opportunity to marry a streetcar conductor, she refuses and holds out for a millionaire. everyone makes fun of her for her fantasy, but are surprised when one day she really does meet a millionaire, son of the owner of the popular abc restaurant chain. the two marry hastily, but the girl's dreams of wealth are shattered when the rich father disowns his son for marrying a gold digger. however, she truly loves her new husband and the two are unexpectedly successful at making it on their own.<br /><br />a rare glimpse of movie star viola dana, this film is a lot of fun. dana's role is accessible, natural, and entertaining. she displays a knack for comedy as well as an ability to do drama.<br /><br />the mechanics of the film are a lot of fun too. the camera displays sophisticated late silent techniques like mobility. the title cards are also incredibly clever.<br /><br />if you like films like my best girl, it, or the patsy, you will enjoy this film.	0
"yes this movie is predictable and definitely not award-material. but then it doesn't try to be anything it is not. a fun-filled romp with real funny one-liners, a stellar and very funny performance by peter o'toole, a grounding and down to earth performance from joan plowright. the band's performance was on the spot, each one playing their role in a deft, comical manner. the music was good though not great but filled out the movie nicely. from some of the negative comments i deduced that the subtlety of some of the humour went over their heads. a good example is the comment about the ""strange baseball-like game"", well my dear american, that was cricket -from which baseball is derived- and the explaining of it to the ignorant us band was very funny for those that do know cricket. also no, you were not supposed to wince when carl broke a window; it was funny how lord foxley said ""oh yes!"" to get more money for breakage and the manager said at the same time ""oh no"" also referring to the money. jeez, it seems that every joke must be explained to some people... all-in-all i enjoyed it and had some great laughs! well worth seeing."	0
this movie had an interesting cast, it mat not have had an a list cast but the actors that were in this film did a good job. im glad we have b grade movies like this one, the story is basic the actors are basic and so is the way they execute it, you don't need a million dollar budget to make a film just a mix of b list ordinary actors and a basic plot. i like the way they had the street to themselves and that there was no one else around and also what i though was interesting is that they didn't close down a café to set there gear and that they did it all from a police station. arnold vosloo and michael madsen did a great job at portraying there roles in the hostage situation. this was a great film and i hope to see more like it in the near future.	0
lavish production values and solid performances in this straightforward adaption of jane austen's satirical classic about the marriage game within and between the classes in provincial 18th century england. northam and paltrow are a salutory mixture as friends who must pass through jealousies and lies to discover that they love each other. good humor is a sustaining virtue which goes a long way towards explaining the accessability of the aged source material (which has been toned down a bit in its harsh scepticism). i liked the look of the film and how shots were set up, and i thought it didn't rely too much on successions of head shots like most other films of the 80s and 90s do. very good results.	0
"whether it's a good movie or not, films of this kind has to be made, i think. it remembers me of ""i love huckabees"", a overwhelmingly puzzling movie with isabelle huppert being sodomized by a young american in a mud pond, in a merry sadistic-masochist way (??!!!!). i hope the director will go on stepping across the border, as though i felt the choices vincenzo natali made, were not always subtle (some of the scenes were unhappily kind of ""tarte-à-la-crème"", like a childish slapstick), speaking about script and cinematography the color of ""cube"" was black, ""nothing"" is white, more cheerful, surprisingly, than the former films of natali."	0
"sitting, typing nothing is the latest ""what if?"" fest offered by vincenzio natali, and starring david hewlitt and andrew miller as two losers. one is having relationship problems, got canned from his job (because of relationship problems) and the police are out to get him (because of his job and his relationship problems). the other guy is a agoraphobic who refuses to go outside his home, is met by a bothersome girl guide who calls on her mom to claim she was molested when he doesn't buy cookies from him. oh yeah, the police are after him too, after the mom of the girl scout call them in to arrest him.<br /><br />man, what a day.<br /><br />what if you could make all of this disappear? that is the whole premise behind 'nothing'. the two fools realize, the cops, the girl scout, the cars, the lawn, the road, everything disappear. there's nothing but white space! this is an interesting concept i thought. i also looked at the time of this, 30 minutes had gone in the movie, and i still had an hour left in the movie. could the 2 actors make this work and keep us entertained for 60 minutes? although the actors try, 60 minutes is a long time and there is clearly dead air in places of this movie. but the two actors, whom are life-long friends with each other and the director, have such great repertoire with each other, that it was fun to watch for the dialogue and improve goofing around the two do. there are lots of supernatural elements, but it's more of their response to these elements that ultimately make this film worth seeing."	0
"clever, gritty, witty, fast-paced, sexy, extravagant, sleazy, erotic, heartfelt and corny, footlight parade is a first-class entertainment, what the movies are all about.<br /><br />the realistic, satirical treatment gives a fresh edge to the material and its pace and line delivery are breathtaking. to think that they only started making feature talking pictures 7 years before this! the brilliance of the dialogue cannot be matched anywhere today, especially considering that ""realism"" has taken over and engulfed contemporary cinema.<br /><br />this film was made at a time when the hayes code restricting content was being ignored and the result is a fresh, self-referential, critical and living cinema that spoke directly to contemporary audiences suffering through the depression and the general angst of the age. i'd recommend watching any film from this period, that is 1930-1935, for a vision of what popular cinema can potentially be."	0
"a very early oliver stone (associate-)produced film, and one of the first films in the impressive career of lloyd kaufman (co-founder and president of the world's only real independent film studio troma, creator of the toxic avenger and, at the prestigious amsterdam fantastic filmfestival, lifetime-achievement awarded filmmaker for over 30 years). having raised the money for this film on his own, lloyd wrote this script together with theodore gershuni in 1970 and in hindsight regrets having listened to advice to have gershuni else direct the film instead of doing it himself. but back then he was still inexperienced in the business and it is probably because of decisions like these that he takes no nonsense from anyone anymore. indeed it would have been interesting to see lloyd's version of his own script - as one of the world's most original, daring, experimental and non-compromising directors he probably would have given it even more edge than it already has. but as it is we have the gershuni-directed film. and weather it is due to the strong script, or the fact that he too is indeed quite a director of his own, sugar cookies is a very intelligent, highly suspenseful and well-crafted motion picture that deserves a lot more attention than it receives. the shoestring budget the small studio (this was even before kaufman and his friend and partner for over 30 years now, michael herz, formed troma) had to work with is so well handled that the film looks a lot more expensive, indeed does not have a ""low budget"" look at all. the story revolves around lesbian camilla stone (played by enigmatic mary woronow) and her lover who winds up dead through circumstances i won't reveal not to spoil a delightful story. this leads to a succession of plot-twists, mind games and personality reform that is loosely inspired by hitchcock's vertigo and at least as inventive. the atmosphere is a lot grimmer, though, and some comparisons to nicholas roeg's and donald cammell's performance come to mind. in this mix is a very original and inventive erotic laden thriller that keeps it quite unclear as to how it is all going to end, which, along with a splendidly interwoven sub-plot with a nod to kaufman's earlier and unfortunately unavailable big guss what's the fuss, makes for a very exciting one-and-a-half-hour. certainly one of the best films in troma's library, and yet again one of those films that defy the curious fantasy that their catalog is one of bad taste. the dvd includes some recent interviews kaufman conducts with woronov and the other leading lady lynn lowry (later seen in george romero's the crazies), thus giving some interesting insight in what went on during the making of this cult-favorite and a few hints of what would be different had lloyd directed it himself. highly recommended."	0
i have to say i totally loved the movie. it had it's funny moments, some heartwarming parts, just all around good. me, personally, really liked the movie because it's something that finally i can relate to my childhood. this movie, in my opinion, is geared more towards the young gay population. it shows how a young gay boy would be treated while growing up. all the taunting, name-calling, and not knowing is something i, like most other young feminine boys, will always remember, and now finally a movie that illustrates how hard it really is to grow up gay. so, i would definitely recommend seeing this movie. probably shouldn't really watch it until a person is old and mature enough to understand it	0
when i think about this movie, all the adjectives that come to mind somehow relate to the physical appreciation of the world. texture, smell, color, that's how i think this movie should be judged in terms of. see the rich golden tones surrounding the young concubine asleep by the fireplace, or the sweltering turkish bath, and let it flood your senses with impressions of spice, coarse cloth, smooth skin, scented oils, flickering flames, satin rustle. don't just watch and listen, be absorbed, let the droning voice of the storyteller mesmerize you.	0
dolph lundgren is back! detention marks dolphs first film in nearly 2 years, and that is following the delayed hidden agenda. this film still marks an improvement for dolph over his cheapie trilogy of jill rips, agent red and stormcatcher. however this film is well below the standard of hidden agenda, which was better in almost every respect. what this film does have in it's favour from dolph's previous outing, is a sense of cheesy fun. the film also has a rejuvenated dolph back in a high action role, and it's good to see dolph doing his own stunts again.<br /><br />the films story is ludicrous and prime b-movie material. an ex-military man is now a teacher and on his last day of teaching, whilst taking a detention class, he runs into some slovakian bad guys who have taken over the school to use as cover for a big drug deal. the film has no originality but in a movie of this type you need to have a sense of fun with all the cliches. if you take it too seriously the audience will find little to enjoy. thankfully the filmmakers don't take matters too seriously and along with all the action cliches you can think of and the predictability, this film has a so bad it's enjoyable kind of vibe.<br /><br />where the film is let down is miss-using a fairly decent budget. the budget of around 10 million has not been well spent. it's all up on screen with plenty of carnage and big explosions but a lot of the shootouts lack imagination. the opening action is okay but after that the good moments become more sparse. there are some good moments. you have a car careering through school hallways for example and a decent shootout at the beginning, with plenty of destruction. the rest of the shootouts are fairly mechanical but there is plenty going on onscreen. <br /><br />as for the cast. hidden agenda boasted the best cast dolph has worked with in ages. there was a good standard of actors for a dtv film. this however has problems. the actors are on the most part bad. the bad guys are terrible, but the lead bad guy has a kind of enjoyable cheesiness because alex karsis plays it so over the top and without the hint of any menace that you can laugh at the pure badness. the teenagers of the piece are actually good but they are playing such cliched characters. they all hate authority, each other and all have bad attitudes and of course by the end they learn important life lessons, but generally they are decent and chris collins in particular has a likeability. this movie is all about dolph though. while this film is nowhere near his best, it is nowhere near his worst. it also marks a turning point in his career. he is now back in good shape, and will be in even better shape in his next film direct action. dolph looks enthusiastic here, he does all his own stunts and it is good to see him play the typical action man (running from explosions in slow-mo, one liners, and handling large weapons) again in a movie like his older ones, albeit with less flair and imagination than cliched films like army of one. it is good to see dolph looking energised. his films of the last 8 or so years have seen dolph looking a little more weary, and using doubles a lot (he still does all the fights himself though) but the new streamlined dolph seems up for it.<br /><br />overall this is watchable if only for the cheese value and dolph in prime action man mode. there's not a single surprise but it has a laughably inept kind of charm. **	0
this is an absolute great show. jessica alba, besides being the most beautiful women in the world, is a great actress. she does a great job of portraying max, and i could never see anyone else doing that role. she is definitely one of a kind and absolutely gorgeous.	0
this is a great entertaining action film in my opinion, with cool characters, lots of action, and an amazing performance from dolph lundgren, however alex karzis is awful as the villain!. the story is very good, and i found the kids to be likable for the most part, plus dolph lundgren is simply amazing in this!. the action scenes are excellent, and it's almost like die hard except it's set in a school!, plus kata dobó is very menacing and sexy as the sidekick!. the finale is very exciting, and it has a couple of cool emotional moments as well!, however i just wished it had another villain, because alex karzis just didn't cut it as the villain way too ott, and laughable for my tastes. this should be higher then 4.1 in my opinion, as i thought it was a great action film, and while the kids, were very stupid at times, they got quite resourceful as the movie went along!, plus the shootouts were pretty cool as well!. the ending is very amusing,and corey sevier's character was my favorite student!, plus dolph has still got it!. this is a great entertaining action film in my opinion, with cool characters, lots of action, and an amazing performance from lundgren!, but alex karzis is awful as the villain, still i highly recommend this one!. the direction is very good!. sidney j. furie does a very good job here with great camera work, good angles, and keeping the film at a very fast pace!. there is a bit of blood and violence. we get lots of extremely bloody gunshot wounds,knife in the side of the head, bloody arrow hits, an impaling, and other minor stuff. the acting is fantastic!. dolph lundgren is amazing as always, and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, kicks that ass as usual, had great chemistry with the kids, had an awesome character, is very charismatic, and he may not have shown a great emotional rage, he still was a hell of a lot of fun to watch!, he is one of my favorite actors! (lundgren rules!!!!!). alex karzis is god awful as the villain, he is laughably ott, was boring, and not menacing at all, he also annoyed the crap out of me. kata dobó is very sexy as the side kick and did fine with what she had to do, she was the real villain in my opinion!. corey sevier is funny as mick, he was my favorite student, and i really started to warm up to him in the 2nd half, i liked him a lot!, he had good chemistry with dolph too. dov tiefenbach(willy),chris collins(hogie),mpho koaho(jay tee),danielle hampton(alicia),nicole dicker(charlee) all do great as the students. jennifer baxter is very cute and is good as the fiancée. rest of the cast do fine. overall i highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5	0
this dolph lundgren vehicle is a fun die hard throwback action flick, it isn't going to win any awards and its not very original but it delivers the goods you would want to see from a dolph lundgren movie. our man dolph is an ex soldier who is now a teacher at a tough inner city high school and when it gets taken over by terrorists its up to him to save the day. sure the script isn't going to win any oscars its good fun and it has its fair share eplosive action. dolph lundgren gives a good enough performance but he comes alive more in the action scenes, and the rest of the cast are not the best actors but they hold it well. all in all detention is an enjoyable action flick, but youv'e seen it a million times before.	0
i just viewed detention last night and i liked what i saw. it was a cool fun movie.dolph looked superbly cool on the bike.he also looked good in this movie as compared to his other recent movies.he is now in a pretty good shape.the story was ok and the other actors were also passable.i wouldn't call this movie his best but its still a good movie.<br /><br />but it also had its share of problems. the first one was the way bullets were flying everywhere and even when they were being fired at point blank range they missed the target.they should've had shown the ppl escaping the bullets in a better way. another problem which i had was the way the students were swearing. i dont know in which school the students can swear in front of their teacher and even in the classroom. the third problem was that the bad guys were very few in numbers. there should've been more bad guys. last problem was definately the fact that the set looked cheesy , but that was due to the small budget. overall the movie was a good movie.i enjoyed it.i would recommend others to watch it. p.s. now u r a dead beat cop. (some one-liners were also cool)<br /><br />	0
there has been a political documentary, of recent vintage, called why we fight, which tries to examine the infamous military industrial complex and its grip on this nation. it is considered both polemical and incisive in making its case against both that complex and the war fiasco we are currently involved in in iraq. yet, a far more famous series of films, with the same name, was made during world war two, by hollywood director frank capra. although considered documentaries, and having won oscars in that category, this series of seven films is really and truly mere agitprop, more in the vein of leni reifenstal's triumph of the will, scenes of which capra recycles for his own purposes. that said, that fact does not mean it does not have vital information that subsequent generations of world war two documentaries (such as the bbc's lauded the world at war) lacked, nor does that mean that its value as a primary source is any the less valuable. they are skillfully made, and after recently purchasing some used dvds at a discount store, i found myself with the opportunity to select a free dvd with my purchase. i chose goodtimes dvd's four dvd collection of the series.<br /><br />rarely has something free been so worth invaluable. while there are no extras on the dvds, and the sound quality of the prints varies, these films provide insight into the minds of americans two thirds of a century ago, when racism was overt (as in many of the classic warner brothers pro-war cartoons of the era), and there was nothing wrong with blatant distortion of facts. the seven films, produced between 1942 and 1945, are prelude to war, the nazis strike, divide and conquer, the battle of britain, the battle of russia, the battle of china, and war comes to america.<br /><br />overall, the film series is well worth watching, not only for the obvious reasons, but for the subtle things it reveals, such as the use of the plural for terms like x millions when referring to dollars, rather than the modern singular, or the most overused graphic in the whole series- a japanese sword piercing the center of manchuria. yet, it also shows the complexities of trying to apply past standards to current wars. the lesson of world war one (avoid foreign entanglements) was not applicable to world war two, whose own lesson (act early against dictatorships) has not been applicable in the three major wars america has fought since: korea, vietnam, nor iraq. the fact that much of this series teeters on the uncertainties of the times it was made in only underscores its historic value in today's information-clogged times. it may not help you sort out the truth from the lies and propaganda of today, but at least you'll realize you are not the first to be in such a tenuous position, nor will you be the last.	0
"the second of the why we fight series concentrates on hitler's grab of the sudetanland and beyond as he makes a chump out of neville chamberlain and embarks on his conquest of europe. <br /><br />clearly meant as propaganda in its day this series over the test of time has become an informative documentary as well with most of the ""allied bias"" turning out to be historical fact. the fuhrer hoists himself on his own petard with smug pronouncements before his people and the world as he says one thing and does another as his army moves east. the czechs and austrians quickly capitulate but the poles put up an heroic struggle against overwhelming odds. <br /><br />the disparity between hitler's military might and chamberlain waving the munich treaty like a white flag, declaring ""peace in our time"" to this day has durable propaganda qualities. here in its original context it resonates even more powerfully as the darkness of world war ll sets in on europe leaving the american viewer with two options, freedom or slavery. in 1943 there was no evading this simple truth and the nazis strike makes its point effectively."	0
adolf hitler's maniacal desire to impose his will on the rest of the world is the subject of this second in a seven part series of films produced by the u.s. war department as an instructional tool for new soldiers entering the armed forces during world war ii. hitler's plan was methodical and well conceived, starting with the conquest of eastern europe, expanding to the european heartland, then moving on to the 'world island' consisting of europe, asia and africa. his final move would be to reach across the oceans for the ultimate conquest of the americas and the world.<br /><br />in 1935, hitler ordered national conscription, as the rest of the country fell under his evil spell. grade school children sang his praises, and young german boys received training and indoctrination in military camps. marching unopposed into austria in 1938, hitler followed by annexing a strip of land bordering germany and czechoslovakia called sudetenland. in 1939, hitler took all of czechoslovakia. later in the year, the world was stunned to learn that germany signed a non-aggression pact with it's mortal enemy russia, a ploy to delay hitler's military involvement on too many fronts. immediately after, germany invaded poland, bringing hitler's conquest right to russia's doorstep. he would deal with her later.<br /><br />it was during this period that britain still declined to oppose hitler's thrust across europe. prime minister neville chamberlain felt he procured a great victory for his country by accepting a treaty with germany, his infamous declaration stating 'peace in our time'. it didn't turn out that way.<br /><br />the most fascinating information to be learned in this installment, at least to me, was provided by a small snippet of footage from a german pro hitler rally in the mid '30's. it was led by a german american taking his cue directly from the homeland. the venue - madison square garden!	0
this great film is composed mostly of documentary footage is currently contained on a dvd along with prelude to war. the great american filmmaker and story teller frank capra made these films which simply and clearly call attention to the main points that caused world war ii and hitler's rise.<br /><br />every school child, nay, every american should watch these films today because they are so apropos. history has been repeating itself over and over again! the lord chamberlains are still alive and kicking; the tactics used by the nazis of infiltrating countries through sympathizers and then the communists and now by muslim terrorist groups, are still working to these evil group's advantage.<br /><br />by sitting back and letting hitler as early as 1935 be aggressive - france, america and england caused over 50 million people's deaths. americans, french and british today would happily let hitler do exactly the same thing despite the fact that we should have learned from history what happens when you let dictators break treaties.<br /><br />these great films may be too simplistic for world war ii history buffs. they don't tell the horrors that the soviet union caused simply because at the time america was teamed up with them, fighting hitler. this film does tell the plain facts and motives that led to the terrible war.	0
i can't understand what it is that fans of the genre didn't like about this film. it was truly a lot of fun. the special effects were wonderful. i generally agree with reviews and with imdb voters, but not this time. i waited until it came to home video which i felt was another reason that i wouldn't enjoy the film. i believe special effects films need to be seen on the big screen, but again this was not the case. to me the film begs comparison to two films that were released around the same time. blair witch and the mummy. both films that i thought were terrible. blair was probably the most overrated horror film of all time. the mummy made gobs of money and it was pure dreck. people liked it for it's special effects. films like the mummy and the haunting are not rich in character development, they are more like funhouse rides. well with that analogy the mummy was a b ticket to the haunting's e-ticket.	0
"what can i say that hasn't been said about ""the haunting""? it has everything that would make a great picture. wonderful sets, moody music, and sound design to die for were all in place. the screenplay, though, sometimes boggles the mind in such a weird, surrealistic way. the entire team must have forgotten to read it through, maybe because they were too busy creating cg effects and building gothic sets to notice how weak the plot was. each member of the cast gives a worthy performance, although with little conviction to the material at hand. lili taylor has the most to do while the others mostly react to her. but that's about it. all i can say is that it was a slightly enjoyable two hours, but you will definitely want more. a lot more."	0
what can i say about it?it's another hollywood's horror flick with very high budget(80 million dollars).not scary at all,it offers us only a few thrills and one really creepy sequence with skeleton in the fireplace.a lot of computer generated special effects and nothing more.catherine zeta-jones is beautiful as always,lili taylor is also a good actress.the architecture of the hill house is amazing,all these monuments,statues,furniture...delicious!however i don't like the ending because it was so luscious.check this one out and form your own opinion on it.i give this picture 7 out of 10.	0
i just got puzzled why damn fox canceled the season3 although season2 was not as good as season1 which is excellent indeed!!!i like it so much that i even thinking about buying dvd on amazon.(failed! :_(i am a chinese student and it's inconvenient for me to get a international credit card and $).i just hope fox can bring back da someday somehow!	0
i rented this movie this past weekend, cranked up the surround sound system, and got some great sound from special affects. this movie is a great movie rental, the special affects where enough to scare my fiance, but i noticed some looked suprisingly computer generated. i didn't go to the movies and see this, but its a scary late night don't feel like going out movie. i would recommend it!	0
some films just simply should not be remade. this is one of them. in and of itself it is not a bad film. but it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title. liam neeson was excellent as he always is, and most of the cast holds up, with the exception of owen wilson, who just did not bring the right feel to the character of luke. but the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the shirley jackson story in it's attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects. again i will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film. but you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more.	0
i don't know why the critics trashed this movie. i hardly ever agree with them anyway.<br /><br />the movie could have been a little scarier - i don't usually go to horror movies! i even had to psych myself up to see it in the daytime. i needn't have bothered! ;) (the cinema was full of kids too, heh! ;) ... liam was great as always. i also liked catharine zeta jones (theo) and lili taylor (eleanor-nell)<br /><br />the house was very gothic and beautiful in a spooky way. the special and sound effects were awesome. i also loved the music score, particularly the gentle tunes for eleanor and her journey to save the children, how she grew out of her stagnant routine and life and finally gain her power, peace and freedom.	0
i know it is fashionable now to hate this movie. i have seen hundreds of spook films including he original 1963 haunting as well as most of the hammer films. this film is not restrained and does not hold back at all which is probably why so many modern viewers seemed not to like it. yet many viewers can accept out of control films like scream because knife killers are more easy to believe for most people than demons or ghosts. actually this film had many great scenes and the acting and special effects were great. i have seen it 15 times now and it gets better every time. the director of this film has made a number of interesting and stylish films and was not trying for the type of realism of the 6th sense. the haunting lets go and is certainly not boring. perhaps this film might appeal more to john carpenter fans but more of an traditional plot structure. the old haunting was also a fine film from 1963. it was even more scary. see both and also the innocents and the legend of hell house with pamela franklin.	0
the haunting is a film that boasts a really creepy house, good effects work and sound work, a cast that seems to believe that everything around them is real and that house. there are scenes that make you jump, and the sinister aspects of what went on at hill house in the past, i found interesting. there are genuinely creepy moments in the film and i liked the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets, curtains and the house itself. jerry goldsmith's score gave it the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices popping up around you. what i wish could've happened is for something a little more intense. jan de bont had a pg-13 rating to contend with and i think that he held back a little too much. poltergeist scared me silly when i saw it many years ago, and it still holds up. the haunting could've used a few more scenes of pure terror. the ending was for me, a little anticlimactic. overall, i enjoyed it. the acting is good and there are moments that make you jump. i just wish it scared me more.	0
"what a great barbara stanwyck film that i happened to see the other night. ""jeopardy"" was fantastic. it was made in 1953 and probably for double bills but it kept me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />barbara stanwyck plays helen, who with husband doug (barry sullivan) and son (lee aaker) drive to an isolated fishing spot in mexico for a vacation. husband has a fall from the jetty and the only way he is to be saved is if barbara drives back to a garage for some rope.<br /><br />while there she runs into a psychotic killer (ralph meeker - one of my favourites) and what follows is a game of cat and mouse as barbara tries everything in her power to get meeker to come back with her to free her husband.<br /><br />the film was so suspenseful and such a surprise - i was not expecting such a great film. but i suppose i should have realized - is there anything barbara stanwyck does that is anything less than wonderful?"	0
jeopardy has the feel of being a stock movie of sorts - one of the movies that the studios pumped out inbetween big budget/box office ones. it's a mere 70 minutes and doesn't feature many sets, and the only star is barbara stanwyck. but what a star, of course. <br /><br />stanwyck is a tough lady once again as she runs into an escaped convict while seeking help for her trapped husband in the mexican desert. the majority of the movie is focused on how she deals with her captor, who wants her to submit to him in exchange for his help. some psychological battling there. <br /><br />it's a surprisingly effective little movie - its short length makes it taut, and that stanwyck is great should go without mention (but i'll still praise her every time).	0
the only time i have seen this movie was when i was 10 years old. i have remembered it all of these years as i couldn't sleep for a week or more after seeing it. it just absolutely rattled me. i was on vacation with my aunts in ft. worth, texas and i will never forget it. now, 48 years later, my daughter is trying to get a copy of this for me to view as an adult. it has taken a lot of research to find out what movie it was but i always remembered that barbara stanwyck was in it and finally was able to get the name and reviews on it. i very much enjoyed it, but it gave me quite a scare! jaqui	0
"i like cheap perfume better; it doesn't last as long..."" - ralph meeker's convict character (lawson) tells this to barbara stanwyck's helen character, after he gets a whiff of the perfume that she picked out w/her husband in tijuana...! this line cracked me up, and also seemed like a metaphor for this film - that cheap is better than expensive, because a cheap perfume-loving man who has a way with a 2 x 4 is a better man to have around in the long run! i agree with some of the other comments posted about helen's attraction to lawson. even though her narration states that she wants lawson to be put away, she did seem attracted to his fiery nature, and that passion he stirred up in her wouldn't likely wash away with the tide!	0
dark angel is a futuristic sci-fi series, set in post-apocalyptic seattle, centering on max (jessica alba), a genetically enhanced young woman, on the run from her creators.<br /><br />the dark angel universe is absorbing, (not as much as say buffy, but absorbing nonetheless) with an interesting and believable set of characters. certainly, it is not for everyone, but those who give it time will find themselves watching one of the most enjoyable series out there. dark angel is criminally overlooked, and under-rated, and was unfortunatly canceled after only 2 series. which was a great shame, as this had the potential to become a great series, although its 42 episodes are only 10 shy of long running bbc sci-fi comedy red dwarf. as it is dark angel remains unfinished, so seek it out, and if you want more, lobby fox to make another series.	0
i found this movie to be suspenseful almost from the get-go. when miss stanwyck starts her narration it's only a few minutes until you realize that trouble is coming. the deserted area, the lock on the deserted gas station door, everything sets you up to wait for it...here it comes. at first you think it will be about the little boy, but all too soon you start holding your breath watching the tide coming in. i found this movie to be really stressful, even though i had watched it before and was prepared for the denouement. now a movie that can keep you in suspense even when you have seen it before deserves some sort of special rating, maybe a white knuckles award?	0
jeopardy is a tense, satisying thriller, a cut above a b but not really a major production. it qualifies as almost an experimental film, as the studio that produced it, metro, was desperately looking for new kinds of films, stars and directors to compete with the then new medium of television. the director, john sturges, was an up-and-comer whose best years lay ahead. he had just recently begun directing a level films, and had already proved himself a most capable craftsman. stars barbara stanwyck, barry sullivan and ralph meeker, were at very different phases of their careers. stanwyck's glory years were behind her, and yet she could still carry a film, as she proves here. barry sullivan, as her husband, was one of a dozen or so leading men who got started in films in the forties who never quite achieved the success many had hoped for him. he was a fine, low-key actor, poised, but in an upper middle rather than upper class way, which made him excellent in professional roles. as the escaped convict who is the only person around who can save sullivan's life (he is trapped under a pier, and the tide is rising), ralph meeker is more energetic than usual. this excellent actor had the misfortune of having come to films after brando and clift. he was in his way as good an actor as either of them, but he lacked charisma. his bargaining with stanwyck, which comes down to his demanding sex in exchange for saving her husband (by implication only, as this is 1953), makes for an intriguing premise which, had this been a different kind of film, could all raised all sorts of interesting questions about stanwyck's character. meeker is indeed a more exciting character than sullivan; and in her scenes with him stanwyck is livelier than she is with her husband and son. but as this is a formula picture, not a strindberg play, the possibility that stanwyck might want want to have a fling,--leaving aside the question of her husband's predicament,--remains unexplored. in this sense the incoming tide doesn't quite have the effect one might have wished, though the movie remains tense and highly entertaining thanks to excellent acting, fine location photography, nearly all of it outdoors, and excellent direction by the woefully underrated mr. sturges.	0
leonard maltin must've been watching some other movie. (though i find his guide to be quite a valuable resource, please disregard his comments on this one.) he states ""starts off well then fizzles"" when it's really the reverse - ""starts off tepid then catches fire"". the plot is about as simple as it gets. happy mom, happy dad and happy son take a vacation at an isolated beach, dad incapacitated in accident, mom runs off to get help, meets up with dangerous escaped convict. mom tries to trick convict into helping while dad waits and hangs on for dear life.<br /><br />good white-knuckler given an electric jolt by ralph meeker, appearing suddenly (the director, john sturges, films it in a clever way that will make you gasp) around halfway through as the cunning, desperate criminal. meeker is an unusually flippant, reckless actor (at least here and in the classic ""kiss me deadly"") and he happily snatches the keys to the film's narrative and speeds off with the top down. his character has a habit of grinning childishly and saying ""pretty neat, huh?"" when he's especially pleased with his misdeeds. there is a funny break in the action when they get a flat tire and he tersely instructs his hostage, barbara stanwyck, ""don't go away"". she fires back ""where would i go?"" (they're in the middle of nowhere) and he realizes sitcom-ishly ""yeah, that's right"". the friction between them is a hoot.<br /><br />there are flaws, somewhat ridiculous ones. there's one scene where the police, who have been chasing after meeker for some time, stop stanwyck's car and to evade detection meeker rests his head on her shoulder like a loving husband supposedly would, and pretends to be asleep as she's being questioned. a. he looks conspicuously un-masculine in this pose and b. i think it's safe to say that any adult who appears to be asleep during an encounter with law enforcement would certainly arouse suspicion.<br /><br />still a sturdy thriller which builds to an exciting and edifying conclusion.<br /><br />	0
here's an excellent barbara stanwyck double bill on one disc. the first movie - and believe me the lesser of the two - is mgm's ""to please a lady"" (1950) in which she is paired with clark gable. it is essentially a star vehicle with gable as usual dominating the film with his screen presence. here he plays a macho racing driver who gets some bad press from feminist reporter stanwyck and the battle of the sexes begins. of course after much ado they eventually end up in each others arms and it all comes to a predictable and pleasing close. a bit of a fluff of a move really but gable and stanwyck - two icons of the golden age - make it watchable!<br /><br />but the real meat on this dvd is the second feature - a marvellous and quite unknown little thriller called jeopardy. produced by mgm in 1953 this is a wonderful little gem of a movie that hasn't dated one iota! here stanwyck plays the wife of barry sullivan and mother to their young son lee aaker on vacation on a deserted and remote mexican beach when suddenly tragedy strikes. a dilapidated wooden pier collapses trapping sullivan under a heavy pylon and guess what? yes,the tide is coming in. with not a soul in sight and unable to free him herself stanwyck sets off by car for assistance. after driving some distance the only aid she can muster comes from an unscrupulous escaped convict (ralph meeker) who - in return for his help - wants more from her than money or a change of clothes (""i'll do anything to save my husband""). does she or doesn't she??. <br /><br />meeker runs away with the picture! he turns in quite a brilliant performance! once he comes into the film you simply cannot take your eyes off him! an actor in the smouldering brando style he surprisingly never made much of his career in films. although he gave splendid performances as the unsavoury, disgraced cavalry officer in the outstanding mann/stewart western ""naked spur"" (1953) and as one of the doomed sacrificial french troopers in stanley kubrick's powerful ww1 drama ""paths of glory"" (1957) his only real claim to fame was as mike hammer in mickey spillane's ""kiss me deadly"" in 1955. his performance in ""jeopardy"" should have done wonders for him but he had only a so-so career in films. he died in 1988.<br /><br />because of this release ""jeopardy"" can now proudly take its rightful place as a classic noir. a memorable, taut and exciting thriller thanks to fine performances, tight direction by john sturges, the crisp monochrome cinematography of victor milner and an atmospheric score by dimitri tiomkin. extras, however are no great shakes except for a radio version of ""jeopardy"" and trailers for both movies.<br /><br />this disc is also part of a barbara stanwyck box set celebrating her centenary. hard to believe that the lady would be over 100 years old if she was still around!<br /><br />jeopardy - an mgm winner!	0
does anyone else cry tears of joy when they watch this film? i love it! one of my top 10 films of all time. it just makes me feel good. i watch the closing production number with all the cast members over and over and over!!! bebe benson (michelle johnston) is the babe of the film, imho! i never saw the play but i get angry when i read reviews that say the play was better than the film. the two are like apples and oranges. the film making process will seldom deliver a finished product that is faithful to the original work. i believe it's only due to the fear of public alienation that many well known works adapted to the screen aren't changed more than they are. this is a very good film, it is very satisfying. that's all you need to know!	0
as a disclaimer, i've seen the movie 5-6 times in the last 15 years, and i only just saw the musical this week. this allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasn't in the musical (however, it tainted me when i watched the musical :) ) <br /><br />i actually believe michael douglas worked quite well in that role, along with kasey. i think her 'let me dance for you scene' is one of the best parts of the movie, a worthwhile addition compared to the musical. the dancers and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical, as well as the cast which is at least 10 times bigger (easier to do in the movie of course). the decors, lighting, dancing, and singing are also much superior in the movie, which should be expected, and was indeed delivered. <br /><br />the songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie, the new ones are quite good ones, and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion, especially compared to a musical which has few decors. the one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking, and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters, but their dancing is impeccable, and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical	0
when i really began to be interested in movies, at the age of eleven, i had a big list of 'must see' films and i would go to blockbuster and rent two or three per weekend; some of them were not for all audiences and my mother would go nuts. i remember one of the films on that list was ""a chorus line"" and could never get it; so now to see it is a dream come true.<br /><br />of course, i lost the list and i would do anything to get it back because i think there were some really interesting things to watch there. i mean, take ""a chorus line"", a stage play turned into film. i know it's something we see a lot nowadays, but back then it was a little different, apparently; and this film has something special.<br /><br />most of the musicals made movies today, take the chance the camera gives them for free, to create different sceneries and take the characters to different places; ""a chorus line"" was born on a theater stage as a play and it dies in the same place as a movie. following a big audition held by recognized choreographer zach (michael douglas), richard atenborough directs a big number of dancers as they try to get the job.<br /><br />everything happens on the same day: the tension of not knowing, the stress of having to learn the numbers, the silent competition between the dancersand it all occurs on the stage, where douglas puts each dancer on the spotlight and makes them talk about their personal life and their most horrible experiences. there are hundreds of dancers and they are all fantastic, but they list shortens as the hours go by.<br /><br />like a movie i saw recently, ""a prairie home companion"", the broadcast of a radio show, atenborough here deals with the problem of continuity. on or behind the stage, things are going on, and time doesn't seem to stop. again, i don't if atenborough cut a lot to shoot this, but it sure doesn't look like it; and anyway it's a great directing and editing (john bloom) work. but in that little stage, what you wonder is what to do with the camerawith only one setting, ronnie taylor's cinematography finds the way, making close-ups to certain characters, zooming in and out, showing the stage from different perspective and also giving us a beautiful view of new york.<br /><br />in one crucial moment, douglas tells the ones that are left: ""before we start eliminating: you're all terrific and i'd like to hire you all; but i can't"". this made me think about reality shows today, where the only thing that counts is the singing or dancing talent and where the jury always says that exact words to the contestants before some of them are leaving (even when they are not good). it's hard, you must imagine; at least here, where all of them really are terrific.<br /><br />to tell some of the stories, the characters use songs and, in one second, the stage takes a new life and it literally is 'a dream come true'. the music by marvin hamlisch and the lyrics by edward kleban make the theater to film transition without flaws, showing these dancers' feelings and letting them do those wonderful choreographies by michael bennett. the book in the theater also becomes a flawless and very short screenplay by arnold schulman; which is very touching at times. so if it's not with a song it will be with a word; but in ""a chorus line"", it's impossible not to be moved.<br /><br />during one of the rehearsal breaks in the audition, cassie, a special dancer played by alyson reed, takes the stage to convince douglas character that she can do it. the words ""let me dance for you"" never sounded more honest and more beautifully put in music and lyrics.	0
i watched this movie after seeing it on broadway. i love the broadway musical and i love the movie. i watched the movie like it was not related to the broadway show. i am an avid reader and have seen what happens to most books when they are turned into movies, so i developed a philosophy really early. assume that the movie is going to be based on the book ( or musical in this case) but that while the story line may be similar it will not be the same, it will be different so watch it for what it is.<br /><br />i danced for 12 years before i had to make a choice. i was a good dancer( picking up chorus work in local productions as a child etc) but i wasn't super talented.i was however super talented as a show rider. i was told by my dance instructor and my trainer ( who i spent several months a year at his farm out of state) that i had to make a choice when i turned 14. that i needed to move up from dancing two hours four-five days a week and riding 3 hours a day 7 days a week.. and dedicate to one or the other. so i dearly love dancing and i love this movie and a lot of the other ballet and dance movies. i just chose to watch this movie for what it is, it is a great movie about raw emotion and human interaction. it is about the power of anticipation and heartbreak when you work really hard to get something you want and you just do not get it. i love the movie. i love the broadway musical.	0
as many reviewers here have noted, the film version differs quite a bit from the stage version of the story. i have never seen the stage version of the story, and therefore i have a more favorable review of the film than many other reviewers. perhaps richard attenborough was not the best choice for director of the film, but the film is still an entertaining account of several dancers trying to make the big time in choreographer michael douglas' show. the film does right by not selecting any famous actors or performers to wind up in the final try-out group. this way our attention is focused on the dancers' movements and individual stories and struggles as they unfold during a marathon day of try-outs. douglas is also probably not the best choice for the part. apparently some songs were cut out in favor of a new one, and the backstage cliché-ridden story of a romantic liaison between a dancer and the choreographer was added. i have to say in all fairness this was the weakest part of the film. the repeated intrusions cassie made during try-outs appear to mirror the almost desperate pleas one often has to make when engaging in the artistic professions in the absence of talent and/or luck. however, this aspect of the film has been done to death in the past, and it's curious to see this tired old shoe kicking its heel up once again. the revelations of the dancers themselves began promisingly enough with the ""i can do that"" number, but then it plodded a little at various points while the dancers were telling their stories. frankly, their stories differed little from real life folks who never get a chance like this. *** of 4 stars.	0
this movie will always be a broadway and movie classic, as long as there are still people who sing, dance, and act.	0
this show is so full of action, and everything needed to make an awsome show.. but best of all... it actually has a plot (unlike some of those new reality shows...). it is about a transgenic girl who escapes from her military holding base.. i totally suggest bying the dvds, i've already preordered them... i suggest you do to...	0
this is a great film!! the first time i saw it i thought it was absorbing from start to finish and i still do now. i may not have seen the play, but even if i had it wouldn't stop me thinking that the film is just as good.	0
i love this movie. i mean the story may not be the best, but the dancing most certainly makes up for it. you get to know a little bit about each character the way they want you to learn about them. i just think that you won't like this movie unless you're into broadway...	0
hi for all the people who have seen this wonderful movie im sure thet you would have liked it as much as i. i love the songs once you have seen the show you can sing along as though you are part of the show singing and dancing . dancing and singing. the song one is an all time fave musical song too and the strutters at the end with the mirror its so oh you have to watch this one	0
i don't agree with one of the reviewers who compared this film to the american international pictures. basil deardon has directed a brutally realistic film with an honest attempt to portray the rise of juvenile delinquency in post war england (but without the sentimentality of ""blackboard jungle""). the cinematography was excellent as it really captured the scariness and isolation of the huge housing estate. the estate looked like an old prison. stanley baker was excellent as the hardened detective, reassigned to the juvenile division - ""urgent, urgent - larceny - five iced lollies""!!!! he finds he is the butt of many jokes. david mccallum showed that he was one of britain's top young talents of the fifties. (he had a very different role in another stanley baker film ""hell drivers""). his portrayal of johnny and the fanatical following he inspired was very frightening. ann heywood was also very good as the cynical cathie. i wouldn't say there was a romantic subplot in it.<br /><br />detective jack truman is investigating a string of arson attacks by someone labeled the ""firefly"". just as he finds evidence which could lead to a breakthrough, he is assigned to the juvenile division - he is pretty disgusted at what he feels is not proper police work. amid all the heckling he gets his first call out - the 6 year old murphy twins are working a scam at the local lolly shops!!!<br /><br />taking the twins home he meets their brother, the charismatic johnny, and their embittered sister cathie. he starts to appreciate how life on the ghastly housing estates can turn young kids into criminals. as he gets more involved with the family, he realises there is a strong link between the fires, johnny and a frightened chinese youth who works for a laundry. the local priest (peter cushing in an unusual role, away from the hammer horrors) explains that when johnny was younger he had rescued some people from a burning building and had been hailed a hero. he wanted to recapture the feeling of importance and being useful and felt he could by lighting fires. the school siege was filmed in a very real way and the viewer felt the children's fear - the teacher (thinking only of her own safety) runs off and locks them in the room with the frightened gunman!!!!<br /><br />i thought it was a really excellent film that tried to show some of the social problems britain experienced after the war.<br /><br />highly recommended.	0
i've long wanted to see this film, being a fan of both peter cushing and david mccallum. i agree that the romantic sub-plot was a waste of time, but the talent of mccallum shines through this juvie role. thank heavens for turner classic which aired the show last week. i can imagine that there were lots of problems with children after the war, especially with the way things were throughout the 1950s. some of the boys are a bit scary. i certainly wouldn't want to met them on a well-lit street, much less a dark one. there were some good insights regarding the feelings of a firebug as well, or as they call him, a firefly.	0
this film was shot on location in gerard gardens in liverpool, and was the uk's answer to films such as 'blackboard jungle'. the film stands the test of time quite well, with all the moral stories still (or even more) relevant today. the film feature some fine performance from some notable british actors such as david mccallum, stanley baker, peter cushing and anne heywood. baker plays a liverpool cop assigned to juvenile liaison duties, with the premise that if you catch the kids at an early age, they will end up being responsible adults.<br /><br />notable cameos in the film include freddie starr (fred fowell) and melvyn hayes (gloria). tsai chin and michael chow play brother and sister (they are real life brother and sister) who are caught up in an arsonists web. tsai chin is still acting and can be seen in the latest nicole kidman film 'the interpretor'.<br /><br />violent playground features a gun siege in a school, so is unlikely to be shown on tv following similar events in scotland / russia.<br /><br />i lived in gerard gardens where the film was shot (though was not born at the time), and have fond memories of the area. i have recently completed a documentary on gerard gardens which includes extracts from 'violent playground', and a small uk film 'coast to coast' which stars lenny henry and pete postlewaite. the tenements were demolished in 1987 and the films go some way in keeping the memory alive.<br /><br />there were some complaints from the residents when the film was released, as the film portrayed the area in a bad light. time has helped heal those wounds.<br /><br />a little gem of a film, i would recommend you seek this out	0
this film was the first british teen movie to actually address the reality of the violent rock and roll society, rather than being a lucid parody of 1950s teenage life. in an attempt to celebrate the work of liverpool's junior liaison officers the opening title points out that 92% of potential delinquents, who have been dealt with under this scheme, have not committed a second crime. however, this becomes merely a pretext to the following teen-drama until the film's epilogue where we are instructed that we shouldn't feel responsible or sorry for such delinquents however mixed-up they might seem.<br /><br />stanley baker plays a tough detective who reluctantly takes on the post of juvenile liaison officer. this hard-boiled character is a role typical of baker. having been currently on the trail of a notorious arsonist known as the firefly and does not relish the distraction of the transfer. however, as in all good police dramas he is led back full circle by a remarkable turn of events, back to his original investigation.<br /><br />his first case leads him to the home of two young children, mary and patrick murphy (played by real-life brother and sister duo), who have committed a petty theft. here he meets cathie (satisfyingly portrayed by anne heywood) their older sister whom he eventually becomes romantically involved with. it quickly becomes obvious that the squalid environment of such inner-city estates is a breeding ground for juvenile delinquency.<br /><br />the elder brother of the murphy family, johnny, is the leader of a gang of rock and roll hoodlums. mccallum does an eye-catching turn as the americanized mixed-up kid, who owes more to the likes of marlon brando, than any previous british star. one is reminded of brando's character johnny from 'the wild one' who led a leather-clad gang of rebellious bikers in much the same way as this film's 'johnny' leads his gang.<br /><br />thankfully the preachiness of earlier dearden crime dramas such as 'the blue lamp' is not so apparent. instead we are presented with several well drawn-out characters on both sides of the law as the drama of the delinquents and the romantic interest between heywood and baker takes the forefront.<br /><br />the plot, whilst at times predictable, does deliver some memorable scenes. the disruptive influence that rock and roll music was thought to have had is played out in a scene where johnny abandons himself to the music, leading a menacing advance on the police sergeant. the most grippingly memorable piece of film however is the climatic classroom scene where a bunch of terrified school children, including mary and patrick, are held hostage at gunpoint by johnny. obviously in the light of the real-life dumblaine massacre this scene seems all the horrifying. understandably because of this the film is seldom aired or available to modern audiences.	0
one of the comedies of the 1970's. also has the best signature tune of any comedy show. the story is about three people sharing a flat living above their landlords george and mildred. the comedy rests on the mix of the people sharing. a man and two women. richard o' sullivan is besotted with paula wilcox. its played in a gentle and not a leering way which is why this show was such a success.<br /><br />the scripts and the stars were always giving the best performances and richard's frustrated love life was shown with a relaxed charm. the end titles contained visual jokes which went unnoticed in the early 1970's but concerned the flat sharers living arrangements.	0
man about the house is a true situation comedy in every sense of the word. the comedy concerns a character called robin tripp (played by the great richard o' sullivan) who finds himself after a wild party, ending up at the home of two ladies called jo and chrissy. ironically the party was held to say goodbye to their old flatmate. the obvious ends up happening as he moves in.<br /><br />man about the house was a pre-cursor to cooke and mortimer's spin off show george and mildred which featured the 2 characters who were landlords to jo, chrissy and robin. these two characters would actually turn out to be the linchpins of man about the house with mildred (the late and much missed yootha joyce) in particular getting some of the best lines of the series. a semi-regular character was larry (doug fisher) a useless person who was always on the scrounge and only ever came round when he wanted to borrow something (and never to return it).<br /><br />the american's did a version called three's company but it doesn't stand a chance when compared to this far funnier original. thames took a risk in producing a comedy about a man sharing a flat with 2 women at a very conservative time but they should worry as the ratings at the time suggest that around 20 million people just wanted to watch a good old fashioned bit of comedy with inspired casting and a sharp script. what a pity modern comedy can't reach that high standard.<br /><br />this programme is available on network dvd	0
like a lot of series pilots, dark angel's opener shows a mixture of great potential and a slight problem finding its own feet. not that this is unusual in any way, but there is a feeling that it could have worked better if the story was tightened and focused a little more. in today's world where something has to catch on instantly or face cancellation, the series did itself a bit of a disservice by not coming out at least halfway focused, with all guns blazing.<br /><br />the ninety-minute pilot really feels like two episodes glued together, and both episodes have a problem with focus. in the first half, we are introduced to max and filled in on what drives her. we also get a few interesting routines with max using her abilities to win bets, interacting with a pi, or sorting out co-workers' domestic problems. the problem here is that this is nothing out of the ordinary for any human being with a normal set of genes, on television or otherwise.<br /><br />it's when we hit the second half that we get a story with a purpose and focus. throughout the two halves, max finds herself the focus of attention from a pirate journalist who feels it is mission in life to save the world by exposing one dirty dealer at a time. in the second half, the repercussions catch up with him, and max reluctantly cleans up the resulting mess. this sets up the premise for the entire rest of the series, and it works, but it doesn't quite click if you get my meaning. it's like most of the pieces are there, but a couple that make a complete image have been left out. perhaps they get filled in with later episodes, but that's beside the point. the fact is that the contents of this episode could easily have been told with twenty-eight less minutes.<br /><br />the last of the negatives is that a lot of the support cast are totally unendearing. original cindy in particular is an annoyance, and i doubt that changed during the next twenty episodes. while the acting isn't as bad as daytime soap, it isn't of such quality that i'd commend it. jessica alba is not the worst actor in the world, but she does come up short in terms of being convincing when the story needs it least.<br /><br />the good news is that the premise and the production values are all top-notch. in fact, this series was considered quite expensive to produce, and it is quite unfortunate that it was cancelled in order to be replaced by another show that didn't last a whole season. especially when there was ample time for both shows - they could have simply cancelled one of the pieces of disingenious garbage they flog under the banner of reality tv. the fact is that we need more shows like dark angel, where imagination rather than overhype, are used to draw the attention.<br /><br />in all, i gave the dark angel pilot a seven out of ten. it never rises above the level of throwaway television, and it never got a chance to live up to the potential it shows within its own running time. but the potential is there, and that's often all that matters where pilots are concerned.	0
as is nearly always the case, when britain comes up with an entertaining and/or successful sit-com or quiz show, the yanks will come along and poach the format and produce their own, grossly inferior, version. man about the house is, of course, no exception to that rule. the yanks' version ( three's company ) was unwatchable, braindead pap that seem to run forever. a prime example of quantity over ( non-existent ) quality. the original, on the other hand, is a fondly-remembered gem that had the savvy ( like fawlty towers ) to pull the plug at precisely the right time ( unlike the 637 episodes of 'hilarity' that three's company came up with ). jo was cute, there was brilliant chemistry between the ropers, richard o'sullivan made it all look so easy, the scripts, whilst not exactly oscar wilde-standard, were consistently funny and chrissy was the most drop-dead gorgeous woman who has walked the face of this planet since the dead sea was merely feeling unwell. 'nuff said.	0
while the british produced some hilarious and slick sitcoms in the 1990s - ab fab, men behaving badly, one foot in the grave, etc. - the 70s were the real golden age.<br /><br />in the 1970s there were whole new territories to explore, including the sexual revolution, feminism, and the slowly evolving awareness of a need for ""sensitivity"" that would, twenty years later, become political correctness. attempts to grapple with the confusion of this thoroughly modern world were the subtle and not-so-subtle themes in everything from the skits of monty python's flying circus to sitcoms like man about the house. (by the late 70s this ""grappling"" resulted in more meditative and bitter-sweet sitcoms such as the masterpiece butterflies.)<br /><br />man about the house is a perfect example of the good britcoms of the time - slightly genteel, cheeky, fresh, ingenuous, sometimes outrageous, with some well made observations on contemporary life. compare it to a cynical 90s show such as ab fab, and it is hard to believe the two were created in the same country.<br /><br />man about the house is one of the great britcoms of the 70s, right up there with good neighbors (the good life), and about the house's spin off george and mildred. its quality is attested to by the fact that - as with good neighbors - its creators, writers, and many of its cast have had continued success in british television.	0
some years ago, satellite channel u.k. gold promoted repeats of 'men behaving badly' with the hype: ""here it is, the original flat-sharing sitcom!"". this was in fact untrue. 'man about the house' was also a flat-sharing sitcom and ran from 1973-76.<br /><br />it was the brainchild of johnnie mortimer and brian cooke, creators of the popular sitcom 'father dear father'. when it ended, they decided they wanted to do something more in harmony with the times. <br /><br />in the first episode, chrissy ( paula wilcox ) and jo ( sally thomsett ) are tidying their myddleton terrace flat following a wild party when they find a man in their bath. he is robin tripp ( richard o'sullivan ), a southampton cookery student of no fixed abode. while his clothes dry out, he puts on a ladies' dressing gown and prepares them a meal. they are so impressed by his culinary skills that they invite him to stay. but there must be no naughty business. so robin has to pretend to be gay...<br /><br />on b.b.c.-2's 'i love 1973', shown in 2000, julie burchill claimed that 'house' showed her a way of life she envied. she was not alone. one of the most iconic ( for me, anyway ) images of '70's british television was sally thomsett coming out of the london underground carrying a parasol, and a 'blind' man doing a double take as her pert bottom swings past. <br /><br />a man living with two girls was a risqué subject for the time, but mrs.mary whitehouse had no need to get hot under the collar, it was innocent, good-natured fun. mortimer and cooke's scripts went as close as they could to the edge without crossing it.<br /><br />richard o'sullivan was still playing 'bingham' in i.t.v.'s 'doctor in charge' when this got started. in fact the second run of 'in charge' overlapped with the first of 'house'. he was born to play the sex-mad robin. paula wilcox's 'chrissy' was more streetwise than 'beryl', her character she played in 'the lovers', while sally thomsett's 'jo' was a lovable dizzy blonde. as time wore on, he became almost like an older brother to them.<br /><br />for many viewers, brian murphy and yootha joyce stole the show as the warring ropers. george had lost interest in sex, but mildred had not. they went on to their own show - the aptly titled 'george & mildred'. the late doug fisher was good value as as robin's wideboy friend larry. he worked so well he was made into a regular.<br /><br />within a year of its debut, there was the inevitable movie spin-off. i am not a big fan of the 'man about the house' movie because i think it was stretched to fit the big screen. most of its characters had never appeared in the series.<br /><br />the format was sold to america, where it became the long-running 'three's company' starring the late john ritter and suzanne somers. it was far more suggestive than the british original, with somers often seen in sexy clothing.<br /><br />after six seasons, 'house' ended with chrissy marrying robin's older brother norman ( norman eshley ). fans were devastated to see robin failing to get the girl he loved, but there was some consolation in the fact that he too landed his own show - 'robin's nest'.	0
this is a better than average silent movie and it's still well worth seeing if you are a fan of the silents. however, if you aren't yet a fan of the genre, i suggest you try a few other films before watching this one. that's because the plot just seems pretty old fashioned and difficult to believe in spots. but, despite this, it's still a good film and kept my interest.<br /><br />a nice lady unfortunately hooked up with the wrong man and ran away to marry him. the film starts five years later after she has come to realize that he is really a brutal thief. despite this, she tries to make the best of it and not dwell on how good life had been before this jerk came into her life. however, the rent is due and there's no money, so the lady is forced to look for work. she becomes a personal seamstress for a rich lady whose husband is trying to swing a business deal. unfortunately, the lady who they were trying to hook up a potential client with for a dinner party can't make it and the seamstress is paid handsomely to be the man's date. well, like cinderella, she cleans up pretty well and the man is infatuated with her! what to do now--given that she is actually married and the new fella wants to marry her?! well, see the movie yourself to see how it's all resolved. i didn't like how they handled the husband, as it seemed awfully predictable and clichéd. however, once he was out of the way, i do admire how the film also didn't give up a by-the-numbers finale and left the film with a few loose ends.<br /><br />all in all, a very good film worth seeing, but certainly not great.	0
in watching this early demille work, it was once again reinforced to me that early demille is far superior to late demille. his attention to use of light within scenes is remarkable. his pacing is very good, enabling much to be told in the space of an hour or so. it is a pity that he wasn't as intuitive about the style of his later sound films as he seemed to be in his silent films.<br /><br />this was the first film in which i had seen cleo ridgely. she was remarkable, quite restrained and yet conveyed a broad spectrum of emotions.<br /><br />the ending is wonderful.	0
this film has a clear storyline, which is quite unusual to the musical genre. ""cats"", ""phantom of the opera"", and other andrew lloyd webber's musicals can be considered metaphorical, as they use literary works as their framework. ""biarkan bintang menari"" (bbm)'s storyline touches the very core of human relationships, especially that of indonesian people. despite the fact the film was based on a ""supposedly"" fairytale, it's actually a fantasy of the 'child' in indonesian adults. the dance sequences are not perfect, yet the songs represent how indonesians express themselves. i reckon the choreographer should explore indonesian way of dancing, by not dismaying the fact that indonesia's dance development tends to be more westernized. the dance sequences seem awkward in some ways and not synchronized with the songs and/or music. yet, i still love this movie and regard it as a new wave of indonesian film genre which i hope to improve in the future.	0
and i am a nicole kidman fanatic. i would pay to see and hear her read the moscow phone book, which, for all i know, she may have been doing when she was speaking russian in this movie. <br /><br />all four of the principals are excellent, but the movie itself is a number of good images and better scenes held together by nothing.<br /><br />while one is always ready to suspend disbelief while watching a movie, this one asks too much of the viewer. <br /><br />it could have been very funny (which it is in parts) or quite frightening (which it is in one scene) but the director didn't seem to know which way to go.	0
i must confess that i was completely shocked by this film. for one, i went to see it on a whim expecting something mediocre, but given this, the most shocking thing was that this was in a populist american cinema at all. this is british comedy at its finest - dark, quirky and funny in ways that american films just never are. i must stop short, however, of recommending this wholeheartedly to anyone; i went to see it with several people, some english, some european and some american and while some of us loved it (mainly from the first two groups), some hated it and found it worthless. if you think you're into this kind of thing then go. if not, don't. 10/10.	0
i didn't really know what to expect when going out to watch the film, apart from the slightly surreal basic plotline that a lonely man orders a russian bride over the internet. that and it had nicole kidman in it. i absolutely loved the film though, and came out thinking 'wow'.<br /><br />refreshingly down to earth, the film moves along nicely, with a few suprises at each corner. the relationships in the film are believeable, with nicole and chaplin working against each other beautifully. the humour is subtle, with some great 'office'-like scenes at the bank, and the thriller element add tension without being hollywood.<br /><br />overall the film is about real people in an unusual situation. it's less about heroics and more about delicate relationships. brit-filmmaking at its best...<br /><br />(9/10)	0
as usual, hollywood stereotyped everyone in the movie. but, this one is a classic - from the uptight white collar banker to the russian woman!! well done. even facial expressions were great! language was perfect (even in russian language) and nicole did a splendid job!! hey guys - you get what you pay for:)	0
excellent movie, albeit slightly predictable. i have to comment on nicole kidmans acting in this movie. some of her other works haven't shown the amazing talent this woman has, but birthday girl doesn't suffer from this in the slightest. even without words kidmans acting shines through.	0
i caught this on the dish last night. i liked the movie. i traveled to russia 3 different times (adopting our 2 kids). i can't put my finger on exactly why i liked this movie other than seeing ""bad"" turn ""good"" and ""good"" turn ""semi-bad"". i liked the look ben chaplin has through the whole movie. like ""i can't belive this is happening to me"" whether it's good or bad it the same look (and it works). great ending. 7/10. rent it or catch it on the dish like i did.	0
good, funny, straightforward story, excellent nicole kidman (i almost always like the movies she's in). this was a good ""vehicle"" for someone adept at comedy and drama since there are elements of both. a romantic comedy wrapped around two crime stories, great closing lines. chaplin, very good here, was also good in another good, but unpopular romantic comedy (""truth about cats & dogs""). maybe they're too implausible. ebert didn't even post a review for this. the great ""screwball"" comedies obviously were totally implausible (""bringing up baby"", etc.). if you've seen one implausible comedy, you've seen them all? or maybe people are ready to move on from the 1930s. weird. birthday girl is a movie i've enjoyed several times. nicole kidman may be the ""killer app"" for home video.	0
this is a great little film, that's very unique, and creative, with some great plot twists and wonderful performances!. all the characters are great, and the story while bizarre, is fascinating and very interesting, plus nicole kidman is simply amazing in this!. it's very hard to describe this movie, because it really is quite bizarre, it's a comedy/romance, one minute then it turns into a thriller the next, however it was still very entertaining all the same, plus nicole's russian accent was fantastic, and extremely convincing. chaplin and kidman had very good chemistry together, and i loved vincent cassel's performance!, plus some of the plot twists really took me by surprise!. the ending was very cute, and it's unpredictable throughout!, plus this movie is quite underrated as well!. you will feel sorry for chaplin and the way that he is scammed, and i thought all the characters were really likable, plus the finale is especially good.this is nicole's movie though, and she carries it with her incredibly sexy performance!. this is a great little film, that's very unique, and creative, with some great plot twists and wonderful performances!, i highly recommend this one!. the direction is very good!. jez butterworth does a very good job here, with great camera work, solid angles and keeping the film at a fast pace!. the acting is wonderful!. nicole kidman, is stunningly gorgeous!, and is amazing as always, she is incredibly sexy, very likable, had one of the coolest accents, added a lot of presence, had very good chemistry with ben chaplin, and had a very mysterious character!, she was amazing. (kidman rules!!!!). ben chaplin is great here, he is extremely likable, had a cool character, had very good chemistry with kidman, the only thing i didn't like was him taking out his anger out on kidman, even though what she did was wrong, and i loved how he got revenge in the end!. vincent cassel is fantastic as the main villain, yes he was ott, but he was very intense and quite creepy at times, this role was perfect for him. mathieu kassovitz is ok here, but didn't have much to do. rest of the cast are fine. overall i highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5	0
i've had a lot of experience with women in russia, and this movie portrays what a lot of them are like, unfortunately. they are very cunning, ruthless, and greedy, as well as highly unfair. from the robotic sex, the hustling for gifts, to the lies and betrayal, i've experienced it all in russia.<br /><br />i know what i'm talking about. and here are my qualifications: here are the photojournals of my three trips to russia in search of a bride. it includes thousands of pics of many hot russian girls i met, black comedy, scams i was privy to, and the story of my mugging and appearance on russian national tv.<br /><br />http://www.happierabroad.com/photojournals.htm<br /><br />it's like reality tv. you will love it. i spent a ton of time putting it together. so check it out. the russian woman that nicole kidman plays is a lot like the julia and katya in my photojournals.<br /><br />my 3 bride seeking trips in russia happen to be very exciting and would sell, so why don't they make a movie out of my bride seeking adventures in russia? however, there is one factual impossibility in this film, and that is the way which the guy orders his bride from a catalog and having her arrive at an airport. it doesn't work that way at all, so i don't understand why the media likes to perpetuate this. there isn't a single russian bride introduction website that works this way, and i challenge anyone to find one that does. the fact is, you can only order the russian lady's contact info (email, address, phone number, etc.) from the website. from there, you correspond and then visit her, and if you want to bring her to your country, you start the immigration process at your ins office, and wait months after that. that's how it works in real life. you can't just order her to arrive at your airport. us immigration would never allow such a thing to happen.<br /><br />wumaster <br /><br />- i got everything i wanted by going abroad! you can too! http://www.happierabroad.com	0
nicole kidman is a wonderful actress and here she's great. i really liked ben chaplin in the thin red line and he is very good here too. this is not great cinema but i was most entertained. given most films these days this is high praise indeed.	0
every time i see nicole i like her more. i love a movie like this. a woman you just won't give up on, but she keeps breaking your heart. first movie i remember seeing like this was of human bondage, the kim novak - laurence harvey version. the beefs about the correctness of the russian spoken in this film are petty, it was good enough to fool me or anybody else who can't speak russian, i'm sure. funny how people miss the point. the no-goodnik russian guys were well cast too. finally, i have to tip my hat to ben chaplin, as somebody else noted, he plays a sap with great dignity, and there was definitely some heat between him and nicole. to think, guys get paid for that, mind-blowing.	0
modern, original, romantic story.<br /><br />very good acting of both nicole kidman and ben chaplin.<br /><br />miss kidman does a nice job in imitating a russian accent. ben chaplin is also good as the shy, dull clerk. for the men (and some women) : miss kidman looks fantastic and is very sympathetic. i forgot what a gorgeous woman she is. it's not hard to imagine that john falls in love with her. some unexpected turns in the story are good for the suspense. although i hoped for a happy ending, the last part of the movie was quite a surprise for me. <br /><br />conclusion : good movie. <br /><br />les pays-bas : huit points.	0
a small funny film. it is totally incredible, unbelievable, impossible. but it is funny how an introverted masochist can become totally dependent and mesmerized, even hypnotized by a girl he hardly knows but who was able to get down into his phantasms. of course it is a denunciation of the foolish deals you can get to on the internet. you must not believe ten percent of what you're told there and never, ever, ever accept to tie up your hands in a way or another to someone or something or some organization you do not know personally. most of their ""businesses"" there are in a way or another going to fool you and raid you. but here the chap deserves being the victim of such gangsters because he is not only naive, he is absurdly silly. but then the film becomes funny because it ends up with the victim of the crooked business having the upper hand and ending up playing the same game with his victimizer and winning. one think is sure too. security in english airports is not exactly what it should be, but i guess it's not better anywhere else in the world and even now they have tightened up all rules and regulations it is just fun to go through their procedures and foil them systematically. then they have their vengeance by losing your luggage, a real plague on modern airports, and don't expect to get fair compensation. or even confiscating a bottle opener or a can opener because it may be dangerous. i can see myself cutting my way through the side of the plane with a can opener. funny, isn't it? dr jacques coulardeau, university paris dauphine, university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne & university versailles saint quentin en yvelines	0
when i saw birthday girl i liked it so much i set out to see every nicole kidman film i could, only to find all of them a disappointment compared to it. i theorize that while the presence of a particular star usually guarantees a certain level of quality because of their artistic control, with nicole kidman the influence she exerts is detrimental to film enjoyment--imho. thus for instance, dogville, even depriving the viewer of anything visual to detract from the existential insight she is hammering home, or other films promoting gay and lesbianism as worthy of anyone else's attention, or other pet causes of kidman's. <br /><br />here she is a natural woman and she does a really great job. i don't how or who was able to restrain her, but apparently it worked. the way the film depicts her openness despite her resistance gets to the heart of what makes a woman a woman. and consequently, what makes a man's most desperate hopes marginally attainable. <br /><br />of course, the fact the male lead transforms from a milquetoast clerk to macho man in the space of one film sounds like a male ego expansion fantasy, but his transformation is adequately believable. it isn't coyly contrived as it would be in a film engineered to bolster male ego. instead it accurately records necessary growth arising from the films unique circumstances.<br /><br />also quite charming is the way the criminals are portrayed as perfectly human, apart from their criminal mission. her gang has a coed rough and tumble fellowship which is foreign to american culture. and while they are his adversaries, they are never really his enemy. in effect, they teach him to be compete.<br /><br />i really marveled at kidman's ability to physically appear russian. it had me wondering whether her ancestry was russian, but none of the photos of her i examined showed any hint of it. maybe it is just makeup but it was amazing. <br /><br />i can only hope that they knock her over the head again soon so she can turn out another great film. despite my gratuitous digs at ms. kidman, the message is this is a superior film in every way and probably the role of a lifetime.	0
i bought dark angel seasons 1 & 2 two weeks ago, after catching a couple of season 1 episodes on channel 5. nothing prepared me for how brilliant the show is. i haven't enjoyed anything as much since firefly (also and amazing show). i'll admit season 2 wqasn't quite as good, but there are still some amazing episodes (see designate this, bag 'em, the berrisford agenda, harbor lights, freak nation etc.) and alec is great. i've heard some of the plans for the would-be season 3, and i have to say, i can't believe it was cancelled - i won't spoil it for you - but it would have rocked! i also think it has a lot of potential as a movie (although at the moment it seems highly unlikely). as proof of my obsessiveness, max's barcode number is 332960073452, and in the two weeks i've had it, i am 3 episodes away from having watched both seasons twice. it's just too good.	0
the first von trier movie i've ever seen was breaking the waves. sure a nice movie but it definitely stands in the shadow of europa. europa tells a story of a young german-american who wants to experience germany just after the second world war. he takes a job that his uncle has arranged for him as a purser on a luxues train. because of his job, he travels all through an almost totally destroyed germany, meeting with the killing of traitors, and hunt for former nazi party members. the society is suffering from corruption. his uncle has narrowed his conciousness by focussing on the job he has also as a purser on the train. by coincidence the main character get involved in bombing and terrorism by a group called 'werewolves' they put pressure on him to help them placing bombs on trains. the atmosphere is astounding. the viewer is taken from scene to scene by a man attempting to put the viewer under hypnosis and then counting to wake you up in a new scene. just when you think you've seen a lot!!!!!!! europe!!	0
this is a comedy based on national stereotypes, no doubt. if you leave away pretending you know or you care what communism was about and how real russians or brits are, if you accept and are not hurt by the conventions, you can have fun with this film. nicole kidman is at her best, sexy, moving and funny. ben chaplin succeeds to avoid being completely out-shadowed by nicole, and the rest of the cast does good work as well. the final is moving, and logical - movie logics, of course. worth watching, if you accept the rules of the game.	0
the critics didn't like this film. it bombed in the states and as a result received only a limited showing in britain. which was a great shame, because it represents british rather than american humour and should have been shown in britain first.<br /><br />nicole kidman looks stunning and is a totally convincing russian. ben chaplin is the dustin hoffman character from 'the graduate', and 'birthday girl' has at least 4 scenes which remind the viewer of that 1960s classic (despite being a totally different story!).<br /><br />sure it changes tack a number of times from comedy to black comedy to thriller to adventure - but it's memorable, moving and a weclome breath of fresh air compared to the average mega-budget blockbuster.<br /><br />see it with an open mind!	0
from what critics and audiences indicated, birthday girl had to be a big fat clinker. still, because i love nicole kidman, i decided to rent it last night. it proved to be quite worthy of watching. sure, it isn't your basic american comedy, and it doesn't take a genius to realize that it is a very british movie, but that's why i liked it. it was a change from all the other movies around, a breath of fresh air. sure, there were some plot holes, but overall it worked. first off, kidman was fabulous again in a very different, not very glamorous, but still quite sexy role. she just keeps proving that she is one of the top talents in hollywood. not only is her russian accent when she speaks english effective, but there are times when she carries on long conversations in russian and if you didn't know it was nicole kidman, you would never question her authenticity. harrison ford should have taken note in ""k-19."" overall a slight little movie that works despite the horrible buzz.	0
this film is definitely an odd love story. though this film may not be much to shout about, nicole kidman carries the film on her own the rest of the cast could quite easily be forgotten, though ben chaplin does do quite a good job of hertfordshire life with shots of st albans & hemel hempstead town centre depicting the true essence of the area. what starts outlooking like a regular episode of the popular british tv series""heartbeat"" soon turns into a gritty gangster getaway action flick.nothing truly memorable happens in this simple small film and thus ends-up as fairly decent weekend entertainment. a good one to watch, and if you like the hero john are lonely thirty something you may find something to identify with in his character.	0
are you a giraffe?... ask john to nadia, and she, sure of responding well, responds him: yes. in this way begin the communication between a man and a woman who don't know each other, and at the same time, the questions and doubts in ""birthday girl"". a film that i heard a lot of times, but i don't dare to see... until two hours of write this.<br /><br />""birthday girl"" is a passionate movie that makes me fall in count, at the same time, that nicole kidman is one of the best actress (besides she is pretty and intelligent) that i have ever seen. ""birthday girl"" is the story of a lonely and routine man who looks for a wife at internet. the woman that he finds comes from russia. she seems to be that delicate woman, normal, not more. one day, in her birthday comes suddenly, his cousin and his friend. the man, begin to discover certain things. since here, he don't going to be the lonely and routine man that always have been.<br /><br />much of us going to think that this movie is just a regular one with a exploited plot. much of us going to think that the action and thrills are sure and don't novel. but ""birthday girl"" is just the opposite. this movie is full of good surprises, good performances and a imaginative plot that i had never seen and imagined. this romantic thriller with certain funny touch is an excellent natural film with a lot of proposes for the films of it kind. ""birthday girl"" have certain beauty and crudeness in its scenes, but at the same time, certain touching nature, and makes it so deeper.<br /><br />""birthday girl"" is sometimes sad, sometimes funny, sometimes violent, but at the end, is totally satisfactory. and i'm not sorry in say that this is a masterpiece.<br /><br />*sorry for the mistakes...well, if there any.	0
the trailer for this movie didn't do the movie justice. and while the movie didn't know what it really wanted to get across, the first half of the movie being a light, romance comedy and the second have a more serious, romantic drama, the overall impact was much better than i thought it would be. this movie was more of a date movie, but the trailer made it into more of a suspense thriller which it never really turned out to be. kidman, being one of my favorites, of course i'm biased, but this movie proved to be a light, sensitive, if somewhat quirky movie that deserved better. three out of four stars. 9/5/02.	0
for a film that got little publicity, and few people have heard about, this was pretty good. it's another one of these modern-day british crime films that are quirky (""snatch,"" ""sexy beast,"" etc.). it's not wild like ""snatch"" but it's interesting and it has some rough characters.<br /><br />it also has a corny and somewhat predictable ending but early in the show - not late - has some neat twists to make it very interesting for the first-time viewer. basically, it's about a low-key british male who sends away for a russian ""mail order bride"" who winds up, with the aid of two russian male friends, providing a couple of big surprises.<br /><br />ben chapin and nicole kidman co-star, and are very good as are vincent cassel and matthieu kassovitz as kidman's russian cohorts. this is a different kind of film and well-acted. kidman once again proves she's far more than just a beautiful face.	0
john (ben chaplin) is a lonely bank clerk who lives in a small town not far from london. though the internet, he contacts a russian agency of brides. he selects sophia (nicole kidman  the guy could be lonely and shy, but certainly has a good taste, doesn't he?) and when they met each other, he realizes that she does not speak english. the communication between each other is basically limited by sex (again, imagine, what a terrible situation for the guy, just have some kinky sex with nicole kidman!). on her birthday, two russian friends of her visit them. then, lots of surprises will happen. i liked this movie: first, it is almost impossible to be 'labeled'. is it a black comedy, an action, a thriller movie? i believe all the choices are correct. nicole kidman is gorgeous as usual, and i am very curious about her russian: is she speaking russian in a correct accent indeed, or just faking? anyway, i found it an enjoyable movie. my vote is eight.<br /><br />title (brazil): ""a isca perfeita"" (""the perfect bait"")	0
this movie really woke me up, like it wakes up the main male character of this bravely different movie from his life slumber.<br /><br />this guy john (ben chaplin) leads his mediocre safe life of a bank teller in a small provincial english town, until the stunningly gorgeous, wild, girl-to-die-for nadia (nicole kidman), ordered by email from russia, enters his life to become his beloved wife, by johns plan. however a glitch turns up - nadia does not speak a word of johns language. although calm and emotionless on the outside, john becomes so interested in beautiful nadia that instead of using the full refund policy of the matching service, he buys her a dictionary to start the communication process.<br /><br />what happens henceforth in the plot really shakes poor john from his slumber of a decently-paid safe-feeling clerk into a decision-making decently thinking action figure, giving the viewer a subliminal message ""you would have probably acted likewise"".<br /><br />kidman, cassel & kassovitz make a great team acting russians and they are almost indistinguishable from the real thing, ""almost"" only due to the slight accent present in their russian dialogues, however slight enough to amaze a native russian by the hard work done to get the words sound right. nicole kidman proves her talent once again by playing a character quite different from the previous roles, at least from the cultural background.<br /><br />the pace of the film is fast and captivating, and you certainly are not ready to quit watching when the end titles appear, you rather feel that you're in the middle of the plot, and are left with a desire to see the sequel as soon as it comes out.<br /><br />my advice is to go out and get this film immediately a"	0
"i spotted this movie in the video store a few years ago and rented it. my husband and i enjoyed it so much we bought the vhs and have enjoyed it ever since.<br /><br />the plot has been well-discussed, so no need in going over it again. the point is this movie deserves repeated viewings. americans, especially, aren't going to get all the jokes the first time around. i know i didn't.<br /><br />this movie is funny, touching, sad-- all at the same time. when ray proposes the toast at his daughter's wedding, it's cringe-inducing. when karen calls tony ""brian"" as he attempts to kiss her, it's heartbreaking. when beano is finally cornered by the woman in black, it's too funny for words.<br /><br />and the music: it's as good as any movie soundtrack i've heard in years. i was dancing in the living room to ""all over the world."" <br /><br />every performance is absolutely perfect. bill nighy has been justly complimented for his portrayal of ray, a man who has had one too many bad trips. stephen rea is perfect as tony, the lovable keyboard player who has carried a torch for karen all these years. he has an appealing hangdog look that makes women want to hug him. but all the actors are equally brilliant.<br /><br />ignore any pans you read about this movie and see it. it's a gem."	0
"another example of the unique talents of cary grant. a performance worthy of oscar consideration, yet once again shunned by the academy. mr. grant runs the gamut from silly to tender in this marvelous comedy about a man who decides to move out of the big city. the pitfalls of building a home are well chronicled and became the basis (loosely) for the more modern tom hanks vehicle, ""the money pit"".<br /><br />if you like good old fashioned comedy without the cursing and the gratuitous sex, this movie is a must see."	0
in the voice over which begins the film, hughie(billy connolly), a roadie for the great 70's band strange fruit, said the reason lightning struck at a rock festival to stop strange fruit's set was that god was sick of 70's excess. indeed, it's been popular to put down that era of music, and see punk as a welcome antidote to it. while i agree the excess was tiresome(as well as the misogynistic urges which came out of it), and like punk, i still am a fan of what is considered classic rock or glam rock, and this film about strange fruit's long, strange reunion is an affectionate tribute to those days.<br /><br />one of the reasons the film works is the care of the people behind the scenes. brian gibson directed what's love got to do with it, about tina turner(while i had problems with the dramatic parts of the film, the music was handled very well), writers dick clement and ian le frenais co-wrote the commitments and were behind the music-oriented british tv show over the rainbow, and the songs strange fruit played were co-written by foreigner's mick jones(not to be confused with the clash's mick jones), so it was a meeting of people who knew what they were talking about. also, two cast members are musicians in their own right(bill nye i don't know about, though the film credits him with his own singing, and he certainly looks like a lead singer of that era, while jimmy nail was in another british tv show which was music-oriented, though i forget the name, and he was in evita), and the others are convincing at it. and while, as i said, a lot of 70's bands like strange fruit behaved badly towards women, the movie doesn't make the same mistake(except for the woman who follows timothy spall around); as the manager of the reunion, juliet aubrey is quite good and plays a fully rounded character.<br /><br />the other actors are all good as well, with special praise to stephen rea, who handles the more dramatic role well without sentimentality. there are a couple of plot points which don't work, but overall this is quite enjoyable. oh yeah, and the music is good too.	0
if you need cheering up on a cold weekday evening, this is the film for you! excellent script and perfectly cast actors. i especially loved ray psyching himself up in front of the mirror before gigs - inspired!	0
"so i rented ""still crazy"" instead. when i described hardcore logo to the guy at the video store, he said that sounded kind of like still crazy. so i rented it. was i disappointed? well, yes, as still crazy focuses on a classic rock band rather than a punk band, but that's ok. still crazy tells the story of the strange fruit, a rock band that broke up in the 70s at the peak of their popularity at a large rock festival. twenty years later, the band members are all struggling to make a living, and are offered the opportunity to play a concert at the twenty year anniversary of this festival. they take up the offer and decide to reform on a permanent basis, touring europe in the process. some quite funny hijinks ensue, and all the characters go through subtle changes. watching this movie, you feel more like a viewer of a carefully edited documentary than a participant. and that's not bad at all."	0
this reminded me of spinal tap, on a more serious level. it's the story of a band doing a reunion tour, but things are not harmonious between them. i was especially impressed with the performance of bill nighy as ray. you felt sorry for him, yet he had a certain creepiness about him. it's a great movie to watch if you have ever seen your favorite band get wrinkly,old and pathetic.bittersweet, highly recommended..	0
"> contrary to most reviews i've read, i didn't feel this followed any of the other rock movies (""spinal tap"", etc.) the story was more unique, although i feel most people wanted to see the ""sex, drugs & rock and roll"" vices that the band kept alluding to.<br /><br />> as an american, i knew a few of the actors - spall, connelly & rea. surprised to find out ""brian""/bruce robinson was in zifferedi's (<sp?) classic ""romeo & juliet"". guess i'll have to rent that next.<br /><br />> ""the flame still burns"" - my wife, who hails from mexico, didn't follow the english/british language too well, missed some of the jokes (which i dutifully explained) but she cried her eyes out at the concert scene. she loves the song so much now.<br /><br />> funny that amazon.com has the soundtrack for $30+usd when i bought the dvd in the bargain bin at wal-mart for $5.50usd. price non-withstanding, i first saw this on late night cable and have been dying to find it ever since."	0
the funky, yet strictly second-tier british glam-rock band strange fruit breaks up at the end of the wild'n'wacky excess-ridden 70's. the individual band members go their separate ways and uncomfortably settle into lackluster middle age in the dull and uneventful 90's: morose keyboardist stephen rea winds up penniless and down on his luck, vain, neurotic, pretentious lead singer bill nighy tries (and fails) to pursue a floundering solo career, paranoid drummer timothy spall resides in obscurity on a remote farm so he can avoid paying a hefty back taxes debt, and surly bass player jimmy nail installs roofs for a living. former loving groupie turned patient, understanding, long-suffering manager juliet aubrey gets the group back together for an ill-advised, largely ineffectual and hilariously disastrous twenty years later nostalgic reunion tour of europe. our lovably ragged bunch try gamely, but fumblingly to reignite a flame that once burned quite brightly back in the day. scraggly zonked-out roadie billy connelly and cocky eager beaver young guitarist hans matheson tag along for the delightfully bumpy, trouble-plagued, but still ultimately rewarding and enjoyable ride.<br /><br />director brian gibson shows tremendously infectious respect and adoration for both his amiably screwy characters in particular and loud, ringing, flamboyantly overblown preening 70's rock in general, this imbuing this affectionate little pip with an utterly engaging sense of big-hearted charm and tireless verve. the astute, sharply written script by dick clement and ian la frenais likewise bristles with spot-on dry wit and finely observed moments of joyous on the road inanity, capturing a certain bittersweetly affecting and frequently uproarious vibe that gives the picture itself an irresistibly luminescent glow. ashley rowe's lovely, elegant cinematography ensures that the movie always looks quite visually sumptuous while the perfectly catchy and groovy music does the trick with right-on rockin' flair and aplomb. kudos also to the across-the-board terrific performances that vividly nail the burnt-out soul and tattered, but still fiercely beating heart of a past its prime has-been ragtag rock outfit desperate to regain its erstwhile evanescent glory in one final bid for big time success. all in all, this radiant and touching gem rates highly as one of the true seriocomic sleeper treats from the 90's.	0
i'm 60 years old, a guitarist, (lead/rhythm), and over the last forty years, i've been in four bands, it's all there, the fights, the foul-ups, the rotten food, the worse accommodation, always travelling, little or no money, and every one was drunk or high. but, the clubs, the fans, and the music, made it all worth it! just like strange fruit! i'm too damn old for it now, and the arthritis in the hands and hips mean no more rocking, but for the length of that video, it all came back, and it was all there! the birds, the brawls, and the booze! and i was young again! it's just like billy connolly's voice over, god likes that 70's stuff! rock on forever!	0
...heads, hands, and feet - a band from the past, just like strange fruit. a triple whammy there. those who have professed not to like this film are either heartless or under 40, and have had no experience of the real thing. sad for them. this is an achingly well-observed little picture that is an excellent way of passing an hour or two, and will probably not even fade much on the second showing. stephen rae, timothy spall as the fat drummer (in many ways quite the most delightful figure of all), and bill nighy - a new name for me - as the neurotic vocalist and front man all turn in super performances, and juliet aubrey has lovely doe eyes to go with some sharp acting as karen, who tries to hold the band together as they spectacularly self-destruct.<br /><br />the syd barrett/brian wilson echoes are loud and clear, mott the hoople rear up before one in all their inflated ridiculousness, and the script is never mawkish for more than a minute. don't compare this with spinal tap or the rutles or the full monty - it's unfair on all of them. the nearest comparison is the commitments, and that's no bad thing. and any film that can conjure up memories of blodwyn pig - a band i do not remember ever seeing, but the name lives on - well, it shows somebody in the team knew what they were on about.<br /><br />a small delight, and thanks for the memory.<br /><br />oh... and i've got another one - stiff little fingers; a-a-and what about steeleye span... spooky tooth... ten inch nails anyone? (you have to see the movie or have been on the road)	0
this is perhaps the best rockumentary ever- a british, better this is spinal tap. the characters are believable, the plot is great, and you can genuinely empathise with some of the events- such as ray's problem with fitting in the band.<br /><br />the soundtrack is excellent. real period stuff, even if it is in the same key, you'll be humming some of the songs for days. what i liked was the nearly all-british cast, with some of the favourite household names. ray's wife is priceless...<br /><br />the film never drags, it just goes at the right pace, and has some genuinely funny sections in it. a generator of some really good catchphrases!<br /><br />it's a hidden diamond.	0
"musings: pure delight from beginning to end. not a laugh riot, but a more subtle, sophisticated humor. what a goldmine of great scenes and character actors, including reginald denny, nestor paiva, ian wolfe, harry shannon and jason robards sr.. <br /><br />cary grant is at the building sight of his new home, which is at that point, being framed. a young carpenter, played by future tarzan lex barker, asks him if he wants his ""lallies to be rabbeted"", or some such thing that only a carpenter would know. grant, not wanting to appear ignorant, replies in the affirmative. at that, barker yells up to his mates, ""ok boys, he wants 'em rabbeted, so....yank 'em out!"" a second later you hear the ripping and tearing sounds of about 20 big nails being pulled out of various boards. all grant can do is moan.<br /><br />yes, the movie is dated. you'd never see that many carpenters working at once on a single family home, and a place like that, in connecticut of all places, would probably run a few million bucks.<br /><br />a classic movie that is really a treasure."	0
what a good movie! at last a picture revealing a unknown side of rock: illusions of fame. well-known rockers are getting old and forgotten, not the music. and with a good sense of humour. have you ever danced on bill haley's rock around the clock?<br /><br />anyway, still crazy is probably the best movie about rock n'roll i have ever seen. far much better than spinal tap for instance. why? because in still crazy, people are mature. they have a different point of view about rock, about love and about life. they want to catch up with their crazy youth they miss so much. beyond the story itself, we see characters with their own personality, weaknesses and dreams. like anyone of us.<br /><br />spend a good time watching this (listen to the awesome soundtrack! )and finally thinking of your own future.<br /><br />bye!	0
i found 'still crazy' to be marvelously entertaining, and not only to those of us who lived through that raucous era of late '60s, early '70s rock. my 15 year old daughter watches it with me every time i drag out the dvd (don't worry, it's only been three times) and she loves it too.<br /><br />it is a truly loving, poignant and hilarious nod to the era, and every actor hits his/her notes with perfection. it was my first introduction to bill nighy and i am glad his somewhat similar turn in 'love actually' brought him more attention. bruce robinson was incredible as brian, bringing real life to what could have been a caricature of the drug-damaged rocker stereotype. it was interesting to see that robinson has made quite a name for himself as a writer.<br /><br />i live in sherman oaks, california, and after the first time i saw the movie i bumped into billy connolly at the local mall (he lived here at the time) and told him it was one of my five favorite films of all time. he invited me to sit down at the food court with him and we discussed the movie for some time. we even talked of the idea of an american-oriented remake before wisely dismissing that. why mess with the original?<br /><br />my only problem with 'still crazy' is that it wasn't hugely popular in theaters and too many people have missed out on a wonderful experience.	0
"hello, i was alanrickmaniac. i'm a still crazy-holic. it was just another movie i watched partly on tv. then i had to get the video tape to finally find out how it ends. then i wanted the dvd, because the tape showed first signs of decay after a few weeks. after the dvd i had to lay my hands on the soundtrack. then on several film posters and the film script. right now it has become that worse that i try to push other people into addiction with my website and still crazy parties. <br /><br />how could that happen? what drove me into addiction? <br /><br />ok, it's one of those funny but somehow sad and melancholic intelligent comedies like only the british can produce. <br /><br />alright, the movie is worlds apart from stuff like ''this is spinal tap'', because of the characters, that aren't childish or ultra cool, but real. this is a story about men getting older, too. a story about men getting along with each other. or don't. it contains some of the best actors possible. tim spall. stephen rea. bruce robinson. jimmy nail. and bill nighy. bill nighy who puts on one of the best performances i've ever seen in a film.<br /><br />good, the soundtrack is unbelievable. foreigner's mick jones has written the songs for the imaginary band strange fruit. jimmy nail who plays bass-man les wickes and bill nighy portraying the egocentric but awkward singer ray simms are really singing. we know that about jimmy nail, but if you've only heard bill nighy's singing in ""love actually"", you have no idea how great and powerful his voice is. <br /><br />well, you'll fever for every scene to come for the x-th time, especially those concert scenes. you'd die to be able to really stand in the dancing crowd when strange fruit is doing ""all over the world"", singing on the top of your lungs. you long to cry and celebrate with thousands of people the rebirth of the real strange fruit at wisbech's festival stage. <br /><br />it's hard but... i'm addicted to this film. i'm addicted to strange fruit. if there's a world where this band really exists i'd like to move there. <br /><br />got still crazy... anyone?"	0
this movie is tremendous for uplifting the spirits.<br /><br />every time i watch it, i see & hear funny little things that i missed before.<br /><br />the soundtrack is unbelievable. mick jones (foreigner) and chris difford (squeeze) penned the songs, making strange fruit the best thing that ever hit today's music scene.<br /><br />unfortunately, strange fruit are a strictly fictitional washed up '60's to 70's band that were never good to begin with, due to drug use and inner fighting. one wonders what might have been, while listening to their fanatstic soundtrack.<br /><br />the fruit draw inspiration from the rolling stones, deep purple, david bowie, and the who.<br /><br />each member of fruit are quite memorable. stephen rea stars as down-and-dead-broke tony costello, who is asked by a festival promoter to reunite his band for a reunion tour, with hopes of reaping monetary benefits. costello haply approaches ex-roadie karen knowles, played by juliet aubrey, to help him rekindle the flame of a dream long past.<br /><br />juliet gathers up the bitter jimmy nail (les wickes), blundering timothy spall (david 'beano' baggot), and extravagantly glamouresque ray simms (bill nighy). tumbling in is another ex-roadie, the hippy-toker-jokester hughie (billy connolly), who never let the flame burn out.<br /><br />as juliet searches for the last member of their motley band, the elusive guitarist-songwriter brian lovell (played by the brooding bruce robinson), the reunited members squabble, just like old times, fighting over each others' rusty talent.<br /><br />the band is then given the chance to do a small dutch tour, to prepare for the festival. with young hendrix-like luke shand (hans matheson) taking the place of lovell, the crew hits the road. the sparks fly as their memories flame forward, threatening to burn their unfinished goals...<br /><br />be prepared to laugh, sing, cheer, and cry, as these memorable characters etch themselves back into your hearts...	0
"this series could very well be the best britcom ever, and that is saying a great deal, considering the competitors (fawlty towers, good neighbours, to name just two).<br /><br />what made butterflies so superior, even to the best of the best, is that it did not just exemplify great, classic, classy and intelligent comedy, but it also expanded horizons, reflecting - flawlessly, gently, and at every detail - the great social change that was occurring in britain at the time.<br /><br />i remember watching this show as a teenager and being in awe of everything about it. the lifestyle depicted was remarkable in itself. this was the first time i saw real people using cordless phones. and the wardrobe of all the characters was far removed from the goofy seventies attire still seen in north america at the time. then there were the decors, shop fronts, cars. these people - even the layabout sons, with their philosophical approach to life and epigrammatic humor - were sophisticated. they were examples of the ""new europeans"" that would come to have an impact on life and style throughout the world in the coming decade (1980s).<br /><br />of course, the premise was strange and fantastic. the idea that someone who was living the suburban dream could be so discontent and restless was revolutionary, particularly to north americans for whom happiness was always defined as money and things (sure the situation was depicted in american movies and tv, but not with the intensity of butterflies or the movie montenegro). and, if the premise was not surprising enough, the means by which it was expressed took it to the extreme. a potential affair that was not really about sex, or even romance? butterflies dazzled many, but it must have left some people smacking their foreheads in disbelief... at the time anyway.<br /><br />butterflies turned out to be - in so many ways - prophetic. it documented, ahead of its time - post-modern ennui, all-pervasive lifestyle, the notion of emotional infidelity, and generational disconnect and male discontent (portrayed perfectly by the strained father-son relationships). it is too bad this series has not been rediscovered in a big way, and all those involved given credit for creating a meaningful snapshot of a certain time and place, and foreseeing all the slickness and angst that was to come."	0
looking back over the past 28 years (since my first exposure to the show), all i can say is: once you get it-it will stay with you forever. i remember my initial reaction being: 1) annoyingly overacted, 2)under produced 3) unlikeable characters<br /><br />well, two years later i watched some episodes again and didn't find it nearly as annoying. a year later i was able to catch the entire series from the beginning and quickly became engrossed in it's bittersweet tale of human fault and perspectives on happiness. yes, the show has a style that is not for everybody, and i'm sure the dated production value would be hard to deal with now. but, i still think about the show at least once a month with a vague teary eyed longing for what seemed like simpler times... <br /><br />btw i am a married man...(for all who think this is a show for females)	0
british comedies tend to fall into one of two main types: the quiet, introspective, usually romantic study and the farcical social satire. settings, characters, and concepts vary but certain characteristics place the vast majority of shows into one of the two categories. butterflies is perhaps the epitomé of the first type. <br /><br />the scripts are very verbal, including long interior monologues by the main character ria, a basically happy but unsettled housewife curious about what she might have missed out on when she embarked on a thoroughly conventional life. when she meets a successful but clumsy and emotionally accessible businessman (who makes his interest in her quite clear), she toys with the idea of finding out what the other path might have offered.<br /><br />the acting and scripts are always on the money, which makes one's reaction to the show almost entirely a personal one: i was neither blown away by it nor turned off. my mother, on the other hand, adored this show. i think the degree to which one identifies with ria's dilemma is the most important factor in determining one's reaction to butterflies.	0
johny to makes here one of his best style exercises, making a strong film with a good yakuza's story. the election of the new yakuza's boss is the beginning of a war inside the organization.<br /><br />in my opinion the violence is wise used in the context, making a very strong gangs film. i specially love the way he tells the history, moving around all the roles inside the yakuza's family, and making that we see the violence, like the only way they have to solve their problems...<br /><br />talking about, the technical aspects, the film is a good example of paused, rythmic and planified way of shooting a film. one of the hong kong films of the year. is like infernal affairs, but without the easy action-violence scenes, and the confused storyline. strongly recommended to all asian films lovers.<br /><br />(sorry for my english, better do in spanish lol)	0
enjoyed the movie and efficient confucian crime drama, the old order survives the threat posed by a brash young greedy man, no doubt representing modern society. i thought the final scene was strange and could not understand if we were to believe that big d was being punished for being greedy or it was part of the plan a long. i loved the scene and for once in a chinese movie, the violence was not a choreographed martial arts fest. on thing that always amuses me about hk films is that the main influence the british seem to have had is to introduce 'yes sir' and 'sorry' into the local language and its amusing that long after we have gone, they are still there.	0
not to be confused with the resse witherspoon high school film of the same name, this is a stylised look at hong kong's triad gangs. called election because a new leader or 'chairman' is elected by ancient traditions every two years. two candidates are up for the position and through ego, bribes and past track record the race is tense to say the least. expertly directed to introduce you to an expansive cast without ever being confusing the story twists and turns before revealing itself in all its brutal glory. the asian godfather this is not, but it is an enjoyable thriller in a gangster genre that will leave you on the edge of your seat and wincing at the violence. subtitled volume 1 i think its safe to say there will other instalments as we go deeper into the murky world of the triads and all their feuding and underhand business deals. either way this is a good start and if there are no sequels a great film in its own right.	0
this movie was a fairly entertaining comedy about murphy's law being applied to home ownership and construction. if a film like this was being made today no doubt the family would be dysfunctional. since it was set in the 'simpler' forties, we get what is supposed to be a typical family of the era. grant of course perfectly blends the comedic and dramatic elements and he works with a more than competent supporting cast highlighted by loy and douglas. their shenanigans make for a solid ninety minutes of entertainment, 7/10.	0
there can be no denying that hak se wui (election in english) is a well made and well thought out film. the film uses numerous clever pieces of identification all the time playing with modernity yet sticking to tradition  a theme played with throughout the film where john woo's hong kong films are action packed and over the top in their explosive content as seen in hard boiled (1992) and when hong kong films do settle down into rhythms of telling the story from the 'bad' point of view, they can sometimes stutter and just become merely unmemorable, a good example being city on fire (1987).<br /><br />election is a film that is memorable for the sheer fact of its unpredictable scenes, spontaneous action and violence that are done in a realistic and tasteful (if that's the right word) manner as well as the clever little 'in pieces' of film-making. it's difficult to spot during the viewing but election is really constructed in a kind of three act structure: there is the first point of concern involving the actual election and whoever is voted in is voted in  not everyone likes the decision but what the uncles say, goes. the second act is the retrieving of the ancient baton from china that tradition demands must be present during the inauguration with the final third the aftermath of the inauguration and certain characters coming up with their own ideas on how the triads should and could be run. needless to say; certain events and twists occur during each of the three thirds, some are small and immaterial whereas some are much larger and spectacular.<br /><br />election does have some faults with the majority coming in the opening third. trying to kill off time surrounding an election that only takes a few minutes to complete was clearly a hard task for the writers and filmmakers and that shows at numerous points. i got the feeling that a certain scene was just starting to go somewhere before it was interrupted by the police and then everyone gets arrested. this happens a few times: a fight breaks out in a restaurant but the police are there and everyone is arrested; there's a secret meeting about the baton between the triads but the police show up and everyone gets arrested; some other triads are having a pre-election talk but the police show up and guess what? you know.<br /><br />once the film gets out of that rut that i thought it would, it uses a sacred baton as a plot device to get everybody moving. the baton spawns some good fight scenes such as the chasing of a truck after it's been hotwired, another chase involving a motorbike and a kung-fu fight with a load of melee weapons in a street  the scenes are unpredictable, realistic and violent but like i said, they are in a 'tasteful' manner. where election really soars is its attention to that fine detail. when the triads are in jail, the bars are covered with wire suggesting they're all animals in cages as that's how they behave on the outside when in conflict. another fine piece of attention to detail is the way the uncles toast using tea and not alcohol, elevating themselves above other head gangsters who'd use champagne (the long good friday) and also referencing chinese tradition of drinking tea to celebrate or commemorate.<br /><br />election is a good film that is structured well enough to enjoy and a film that has fantastic mise-en-scene as you look at what's going on. some of the indoor settings and the clothing as well as the buckets of style that is poured on as the search and chase for the baton intensifies. the inauguration is like another short film entirely and very well integrated into the film; hinting at chinese tradition in the process. i feel the best scene is the ending scene as it sums it up perfectly: two shifty characters fishing and debating the ruling of the triads all the while remaining realistic, unpredictable and violent: in a tasteful manner, of course.	0
"election is a chinese mob movie, or triads in this case. every two years an election is held to decide on a new leader, and at first it seems a toss up between big d (tony leung ka fai, or as i know him, ""the other tony leung"") and lok (simon yam, who was judge in full contact!). though once lok wins, big d refuses to accept the choice and goes to whatever lengths he can to secure recognition as the new leader. unlike any other asian film i watch featuring gangsters, this one is not an action movie. it has its bloody moments, when necessary, as in goodfellas, but it's basically just a really effective drama. there are a lot of characters, which is really hard to keep track of, but i think that plays into the craziness of it all a bit. a 100-year-old baton, which is the symbol of power i mentioned before, changes hands several times before things settle down. and though it may appear that the film ends at the 65 or 70-minute mark, there are still a couple big surprises waiting. simon yam was my favorite character here and sort of anchors the picture.<br /><br />election was quite the award winner at last year's hong kong film awards, winning for best actor (tony leung), best picture, best director (johnny to, who did heroic trio!!), and best screenplay. it also had nominations for cinematography, editing, film score (which i loved), and three more acting performances (including yam)."	0
"first off, i must say that i made the mistake of watching the election films out of sequence. i say unfortunately, because after seeing election 2 first, election seems a bit of a disappointment. both films are gangster epics that are similar in form. and while election is an enjoyable piece of cinema... it's just not nearly as good as it's sequel.<br /><br />in the first election installment, we are shown the two competitors for chairman; big d and lok. after a few scenes of discussion amongst the ""uncle's"" as to who should have the chairman title, they (almost unanimously) decide that lok (simon yam) will helm the triads. suffice to say this doesn't go over very well with competitor big d (tony leung ka fai) and in a bid to influence the takeover, big d kidnaps two of the uncles in order to sway the election board to his side. this has disastrous results and heads the triads into an all out war. lok is determined to become chairman but won't become official until he can recover the ""dragon head baton"", a material representation of the chairman's power. the current chairman, whistle (chung wang) has hidden the baton somewhere in mainland china and the race is on to see who can recover it first.<br /><br />much of the film is devoted to the recovery of the baton. as both aspiring leaders search for it they must dodge cops and opposite sides, which leads into one of the stand out scenes in election, which involves an underling named jet (nick cheung), a machete, and lots of bad guys. nick cheung's presence is attention grabbing to say the least... i wonder if this influenced director johhnie to in any way while making the second election, as he does deliver more of jet's character in the sequel.<br /><br />while nick cheung gives a scene stealing performance, i must not fail to give due to the rest of the film's actors. election has a great ensemble cast with well thought out performances that are both subtle and impacting. simon yam is his usually glorious self and the film also benefits from heavyweight hk actors like louis koo, tony leung ka fai, and the under-appreciated suet lam. there really aren't any weak links in the acting and one could easily believe that they're watching real gangsters.<br /><br />although the performances are great, one of the most impressive things about election is johnnie to's eye for the camera. there are some truly striking shots in the film and it goes without saying that to definitely knows how to frame his shots, as the viewer is treated to a series of innovative and quite brilliant camera placings and angles. all of which makes election, above all, a great looking film.<br /><br />my issues with the film arises mostly out of the shear amount of characters involved in election. it gets a bit hard to follow because the film is so full of characters that aren't integral to the plot. while the sequel opts to focus more on the two candidates, the first election offers the election process as a whole with tons of uncles, underlings, and police officers crowding the storyline. maybe the film would have worked better if it would have been a bit longer with more time dedicated to the inner workings of the triad, or if director johnnie to would have funneled down the necessary elements and expounded on them more. <br /><br />bottom line- all in all, this is a wonderfully brutal film with a great cast, excellent direction, and leisurely pacing that packs a punch. it's just a little more complicated than it needed to be."	0
it might be a little erroneous to open a review by describing a film in terms of other films, but i think it's the best way to give an approximation of the place election occupies in the gangster genre arena. it works somewhere in between the godfather and kinji fukasaku's yakuza opus the yakuza papers (aka battles without honour and humanity), in that it is simultaneously both romanticized and realistic, dark and gritty. but it's also a johnnie to film, and as such it carries the distinct touch of the hong kong auteur.<br /><br />every two years the hk triad elects a new boss. only this time one of the candidates is not overly happy with the result so he decides to take matters into his own hands much to the dismay of the rest of the triads and the police. that's the story in a nutshell but rest assured it has a lot more going for it than that. as in the yakuza papers, there's a great deal of scheming, back-stabbing and forming and switching of allegiances (sometimes all it takes is a phone call - in one of the most memorable scenes i've seen in recent time) which might not necessarily make for deep drama but makes for an interesting plot and good character conflict. fans of the gangster genre are likely to appreciate it in that aspect. election is not as action-oriented as one might expect; although it is violent. and i'm not talking about the glossy, glamour version of hollywood violence. this is dark and grim. to's camera lingers in the scenes of people being brutalized in ways that reveal both the humanity and inhumanity of the perpetrators and victims; after all violence is an integral part of us whether we like it or not.<br /><br />if you're familiar with to's style, then you should know what to expect. the pacing is relatively slow and deliberate. the cinematography is great, slick and dark in equal measures, utilizing dark hues (brown, dark green and orange) while the smooth tracking shots add a vibrant quality to it. in the end, election occupies a peculiar place. it's not exactly a character study and it's not an action-oriented gangster film. it explores a situation (the election and its aftermath), but does so in style, and is both realistic and romanticized (the triad ceremonies in particular echo of an oriental godfather).	0
this movie is great fun to watch if you love films of the organized crime variety. those looking for a crime film starring a charismatic lead with dreams of taking over in a bad way may be slightly disappointed with the way this film strides.<br /><br />it is a fun romp through a criminal underworld however and if you aren't familiar with hong kong films, then you may be pleasantly surprised by this one. i was somewhat disappointed by some of the choices made story-wise but overall a good crime film. some things did not make sense but that seems to be the norm with films of the east. <br /><br />people just randomly do things regardless of how their personalities were set up prior. it's a slightly annoying pattern that permeates even in this film.	0
johnnie to's election has some cool music on the opening creditsand a nice opening credits' design too, a kaleidoscope of chinese characters and those asian mobsters solemnly taking an oath or uttering some sacred stuff; as a matter of fact the whole flick is nicely scored. i have found about to from bishop seraphim sigrist and was quite eager to see a to movie. the one with which i began, election, is exciting and interesting, and only moderately violent by nowadays standardsmoderately and also essentially violent; the story of an asian godfather's scheming, it uses a puzzle play of elements, violent facts from the mobsters' lives, the race for the scepter, true details, and as with coppola we are expected to believe that some of the morally glamorized mobsters are entitled and nice and likable. the performances are reasonably amusing and colorful.<br /><br />election is well made in the enjoyable, somewhat careless style of the hong kong fare; the ending is bitter, true, straight and will scare the kids.	0
"i spotted in the guide to films list for the santa barbara film festival, where i went when i was in hollywood, that this film was in screening. basically there is an election for the new chairman of the hong kong triads wo sing society coming up, so you can imagine how much violence that is going to occur during this. the struggle is between ""candidates"" lam lok (simon yam) and big d (tony leung ka fai) for control of the oldest and most powerful triad parts of the society. also starring louis koo as jimmy lee, nick cheung as jet, cheung siu fai as mr. so, lam suet as big head and lam ka tung as kun. there are some good realistic corruption themes and moments, just about enough action, apart from maybe when the cops get involved, but a sequel followed, so it's a pretty worthwhile crime drama thriller. very good!"	0
"i always thought this would be a long and boring talking-heads flick full of static interior takes, dude, i was wrong. ""election"" is a highly fascinating and thoroughly captivating thriller-drama, taking a deep and realistic view behind the origins of triads-rituals. characters are constantly on the move, and although as a viewer you kinda always remain an outsider, it's still possible to feel the suspense coming from certain decisions and ambitions of the characters. furthermore johnnie to succeeds in creating some truly opulent images due to meticulously composed lighting and atmospheric light-shadow contrasts. although there's hardly any action, the ending is still shocking in it's ruthless depicting of brutality. cool movie that deserves more attention, and i came to like the minimalistic acoustic guitar score quite a bit."	0
the first of two films by johnny to, this film won many awards, but none so prestigious as a cannes golden palm nomination.<br /><br />the triad elects their leader, but it is far from democratic with the behind the scenes machinations.<br /><br />tony leung ka fai (zhou yu's train, ashes of time redux) is big d, who plans to take the baton no matter what it takes, even if it means a war. well, war is not going to happen as that is bad for business. big d will change his tune or...<br /><br />good performances by simon yam, louis koo and ka tung lam (infernal affairs i & iii), along with tony leung ka fai.<br /><br />whether masons, made men in the mafia, or members of the wo sing society, the ceremonies are the same; fascinating to watch.<br /><br />to be continued...	0
"this movie is a little unusual in that it's got a very slim plot and the movie itself is done at a very slow and leisurely pace. while this makes it pretty different from the average grant film, it is still highly watchable and entertaining. it's sort of like someone said ""let's just follow cary around and watch as he gets perturbed at all the little problems that come up when you are having a house rehabbed"". considering what a fun actor he is in the film and the great support he gets from myrna loy and melvin douglas, the film works very well. while the film has pretty modest pretensions, it makes the most of the material. it's a great film for cary grant fans or for the whole family."	0
personally, i find the movie to be quite a good watch. it outlines the actual situation of triads in hong kong and gives the viewer a glimpse of how triads are organized.<br /><br />not only that, it also shows the viewer how the hong kong police control the triad situation and why the police don't just go all out and wipe out triads.<br /><br />overall, the movie is rather violent due to the gangland methods of killings & torture. nevertheless, the movie stays true to the real world, thus the violence on screen is just a reflection of what really happens.<br /><br />i'd recommend this movie to any triad/mafia movie fan. another good watch would be dragon squad. that movie has more guns than this, as in this movie there's more knives than guns (in fact i don't remember seeing a single gun).	0
despite a tight narrative, johnnie to's election feels at times like it was once a longer picture, with many characters and plot strands abandoned or ultimately unresolved. some of these are dealt with in the truly excellent and far superior sequel, election 2: harmony is a virtue, but it's still a dependably enthralling thriller about a contested triad election that bypasses the usual shootouts and explosions (though not the violence) in favour of constantly shifting alliances that can turn in the time it takes to make a phone call. it's also a film where the most ruthless character isn't always the most threatening one, as the chilling ending makes only too clear: one can imagine a lifetime of psychological counselling being necessary for all the trauma that one inflicts on one unfortunate bystander.<br /><br />simon yam, all too often a variable actor but always at his best under to's direction, has possibly never been better in the lead, not least because tony leung's much more extrovert performance makes his stillness more the powerful.	0
election marks the 2nd trial society theme movie directed by johnnie to.<br /><br />to marvellously casted simon yan and tony leung kar fai as lok and big d, as the two trial members who were chosen as candidates for the position of chairman for ho sing society, a 100 year old trial society.<br /><br />while lok is a man who keeps his cool at all times, big d is not only impatient, but also thinks that he is on top of everything. lok was chosen as the next chairman for 2 years. to have the total control of the gang, the newly elected chairman must be passed down with a dragon baton, which represents power and authority. big d was extremely unhappy with the results that he was not chosen to be the next chairman after paying a handsome figure of bribes to the council members. he ordered his man to get the baton before it falls onto the hands of lok.<br /><br />while big d is getting the baton, lok has other plans for him.<br /><br />this is one of the trial society theme movies where not much bloodshed is needed. johnnie to puts the greed of the human beings in the movie, where bloodshed is commonly used in other trial society theme movies to show how the greed of human beings can caused the death or the downfall of one. however, no single bullet is used, hardly any gangfights are involved in election. it's the battle of the wits that makes election stands out of the rest.<br /><br />apart from maggie shiu, the only actress in election with less than 5 lines to talk in the whole movie, masculinity rules the whole movie. louis koo and nick cheung, who was seen in to's previous film, are casted as an undercover cop and a gangster who sold his life to the gang respectively. together with some of the veteran actors making their appearance in the film and the excellent script, it makes the only hk movie to represent cannes fil festival 2005.<br /><br />election has hardly failed any critics who wants an different trial society theme movie.	0
this film really deserves more recognition than its getting. it really is a stunning and rich portrayal of blood ties, favours and allegiances within the crime world. the film is shot beautifully and delves into all you're classic crime themes such as betrayal and power. this film is a movie goers film, it requires attention and understanding and rewards fully in the end. it is the godfather of hong kong and is a welcome change rather than another wire frame fighting, martial arts epic which seems to be the major contribution to the cinema world from hong kong and china. it features an arrangement of great characters, actors and development although is fair to say i had to watch it twice just to nail what was happening with some of the characters due to their being so many interactions in the film. all in all 8/10 great plot characters but there are characters that don't stand out enough and the music didn't really get me going and at times i felt it didn't sync well with the action(there is action by the way) so it loses some points for that.	0
<br /><br />i must admit, i was expecting something quite different from my first viewing of 'cut' last night, though was delighted with the unexpected australian horror gem. i am a true horror fan as true as they come, and found 'cut' to not only be the best of the genre australia has ever produced, but one of the great parody/comedy films of late.<br /><br />my only concern is that mainstream audiences may not pick up on a lot of the comedic elements - the film was not overly clever in it's application but made me laugh at every turn trying to fit in every possible cliche of the horror genre they could. i am certain this was intended as humour....hoping this was intended as humour.<br /><br />and of course, there was the gore.<br /><br />the use of the 'customised' garden shears was brilliance - besides the expected stabs and slashes. in short, there was a huge amount of variety and creativity in the many violent deaths, enough to please even the skeptics of this films worth.<br /><br />the appearance of both kylie minogue (short that her appearance was) and molly ringwald was just another reason to see the film - both performances were fantastic, as well as simon bossell ('the castle') in a brilliant role as the jokey technician.<br /><br />all in all, i think this movie is one of the best horror products of the last couple or years, as well as a beautiful satire/parody - toungue-in-cheek till the very end.<br /><br />loved it. go see it!	0
australia's first mainstream slasher film hits the screen with a bang. and a stab. and a slice. and a scream or two. and plenty of blood, frights, red herrings and lots of laughs.<br /><br />in fact, there's lots of first surrounding cut - it's the first script of dave warner's to be produced, although he has several others either optioned or in negotiation; it's the first major film from director and former hoodoo guru kimble rendall; and it's also the first film for producer martin fabinyi. and for a bunch of guys dipping their toes into this genre for the first time, they sure know their stuff.<br /><br />cut tells the story of a bunch of australian film students who hear about a slasher film, hot blooded, that was never finished because its director, hilary (kylie minogue), was killed by the actor playing the psycho killer in the film.<br /><br />despite their lecturer (who was assistant director on the night hilary died) warning them that whenever someone tries to start up production of hot blooded again someone dies, director raffy (jessica napier) and producer hester (sarah kants) decide to go ahead and complete the film. they put together a crew and manage to get the original star, vanessa turnbill (molly ringwald), to return to australia - in fact, to the original location - to complete hot blooded  14 years after shooting shut down.<br /><br />of course, this being a slasher film, lots of bloodletting ensues  long with plenty of laughs, a few good scares and a rocking aussie soundtrack. cut shows that australia can make a good, mass-market horror film just as well as hollywood.<br /><br />it's a finely crafted feature, with excellent special effects, a taut plot and a killer - scarman - that's a welcome addition to the ranks of michael, jason and freddy.	0
"i was really excited about seeing this film. i thought finally australia had made a good film.. but i was wrong.<br /><br />this was the most pathetic attempt at a slasher film ever. i feel sorry for molly ringwald having to come all the way to australia to make an awful movie.<br /><br />the acting was terrible (especially that australian guy who was trying to speak in an american accent), and the plot was also pretty bad.<br /><br />when i first heard about this film coming out, i thought that the title was pathetic (because it sounds like the cheesy film ""stab"" in scream 2), but i was willing to let it slide if it was a good movie.<br /><br />warning!!! major spoilers!!!<br /><br />probably the worst thing about the film was the ending. i was expecting a big surprise about who the killer was.. but the killer wasn't even human.. which turned this realistic slasher film into an awful horror movie.<br /><br />don't see this film.. you'll probably be disappointed!"	0
i saw this movie with a bunch of friends and although only two of us walked out of the cinema thinking how cool it was, the others just laughed and commented on how stupid it was. well that was because it isn't supposed to be taken so seriously, basically it is a a movie that mocks horror flicks and does a damn good job.. there seems to be another movie coming out like that too, umm... scary movie?? well this is aussie, and original!!! jessica napier does a surperb performance and sarah kants has a definate bright future in acting! i hope to see more of them. molly ringwald was a good move, and kylie was an even better move. the impossible princess was queen of the screen!! i recommend seeing this flick, as you'll be guessing until the very end the connection with raffy, hilary and the movie that never got finished 20 years ago.	0
personally, i enjoyed cut thouroughly. it was the first time i've seen a theatrically release australian slasher flick. a genre normally restricted to the mainstream hollywood films.<br /><br />with all the usual cooky comedies and dramas coming out of australia i loved being able to see a homegrown horror movie that wasn't a rip off of anything. i didn't even think it was really a spoof of other movies. it was a supernaturally theme horror like nightmare on elm street, not scream or i know what you did last summer and therefore there was more of a suspension of disbelief. i think it's about time australian films tried to get more into the mainstream genres.<br /><br />cut was original, scary enough and ultimately just a bit of fun. i'd give it seven out of ten and wouldn't treat it as anything serious. it did what i expected it to do, entertain and scare me enough times to be satisfying. i enjoyed it.	0
there is so much to love in this darling little comedy. anyone who has ever built or bought a house, or even just been short of space,will find that there is more than just a grain of truth in the plight of the addled mr. blanding.melvyn douglas,with great comedic flare, both narrates and acts as the blandings' attorney and voice of reason.as well myrna loy is at her best as a rather scatterbrained but extremely patient wife. but the best performance is grant's. he is the american everyman, especially relevant at the time of this film's release, when the nation was in the grips of a housing shortage after the end of the war. the themes are universal,lack of money, work strain, fear of infidelity.yes, it does wrap up awfully neatly, but you must keep in mind that this was a time when the world was just recovering from a terrible war, and wanted a happy ending. it is still relevant today, and i must chalk up the poor reviews i see to a present preference for dumbed down, gross out comedies. the look of the film is slick, and there are some great bits of comedy is well, particularly toward the beginning.while it may have lost some of it's social relevance, nearly sixty years after it's release, it is still a gem.	0
"it isn't the worst film ever made, the actors aren't apalling and the script and director are not completely inept. <br /><br />it isn't the best film ever made, the actors aren't excellent and the script and director are not completely brilliant.<br /><br />it falls somewhere in the middle. a fun somewhere. an enjoyable, well constructed somewhere.<br /><br />no need to say ""don't take it seriously"" or ""so bad its good"" or ""it wasn't scary"". none of these comments are relevant. <br /><br />cut has atmosphere. it's that atmosphere which is actually very unique, and the one really original aspect of the movie, which personally is what makes the film, for me."	0
"cut"" is a full-tilt spoof of the slasher genre and in the main it achieves what it sets out to do. most of the standard slasher cliches are there; the old creepy house, the woods, the anonymous indestructible serial killer, buckets of gore, and of course the couple interrupted by the killer while they're having sex (that's hardly a spoiler).<br /><br />the set-up is simplicity itself: film-school nerds set out to complete an unfinished slasher ""masterpiece"", unfinished because of the murders of a couple of the cast. this also neatly - okay, messily - disposes of kylie minogue in the first reel. they are joined by one of the survivors of the original film, played by molly ringwald who absolutely steals the film because she gets all the best lines. the rest of the cast fit their roles well, especially the lovely jessica napier, who plays it straight while the mayhem and gore erupt around her.<br /><br />there are plenty of red herrings and fake suspenseful moments, and there is very little time to try to work out who the killer is because the film moves at such a fast pace. it also has an appropriate low budget look, including some clumsy editing which is probably deliberate. good soundtrack, too. if there is a difficulty with this film it is deciding whether it is a send-up of or a homage to the slasher genre. probably a bit of both.	0
this is not a bad movie. it follows the new conventions of modern horror, that is the movie within a movie, the well known actress running for her life in the first scene. this movie takes the old convention of a psycho killer on he loose, and manage to do something new, and interesting with it. it is also always nice to see molly ringwald back for the attack.<br /><br />so this might be an example of what the genre has become. cut hits all the marks, and is actually scary in some parts. i liked it i gave it an eight.	0
this is surprisingly above average slasher, that's enjoyable and well made, with some decent gore!. all the characters are decent, and the story is quite fun, plus molly ringwald played the annoying bitch extremely well. i bought this at a pawn shop for a 1$, and it was surprisingly worth it, and the special effects were pretty damn good for the budget, plus i loved the mask the killer wore as it was actually somewhat creepy. the finale was really cool, as i loved how they defeated the killer, and the ending while predictable was very amusing as well, plus all the characters except for ringwald were surprisingly pretty likable!. it's decently made and written, and i thought it was quite creative and original at times as well, plus some of the death scenes were very impressive. this killer didn't mess around, and i loved it, and slasher fans(like myself) should really enjoy this film, plus the opening was really wicked too, with them filming the movie!. this is a surprisingly above average slasher, that's enjoyable,and well made, with some decent gore, and i say it's well worth the watch!. the direction is good. kimble rendall does a good! job here with solid camera work, using a creepy setting, good angles and keeping the film at a fast moving pace. the acting is solid!. molly ringwald plays the bitch extremely well,and i had troubles feeling sorry for her, after all she was supposed to be the heroine, she turned out better towards the end, but not by much, i'm surprised she decided to do this film, nonetheless she did an excellent job!. frank roberts is fantastic as the killer, he is menacing, creepy and had one hell of a mask, and this guy didn't mess around, he was fantastic!. kylie minogue plays a bitch very well in her small role. jessica napier is cute and does fine as the other heroine. rest of the cast are fine. overall well worth the watch!. *** out of 5	0
for a slasher flick,this movie is actually better than a lot in the genre.yes it is predictable-resident nut job goes on killing spree,people die,yada yada yada.however there are some good positives in this film.first off,i really liked the mask the nut job wore.it is definitely creepy to say the least and possibly unique(although i haven't watched every single slasher film ever made)also,the genesis of the bad due is something i haven't seen before,and he way he finally meets his end is a novel concept,as far as i know.i also really liked the weapon of choice employed by mr sicko,for most of the murders.the murders themselves are not as graphic as most in the genre,but that'a small concern.the movie does not take itself seriously,which is something most slashers suffer from.oddly enough,while watching the movie,i was reminded of the early ""friday the 13th films,which did take themselves seriously.there are a few concerns about this movie.in several scenes,the killer suddenly bears a strong resemblance to one of our horror icons.by this,i mean his movements and his reactions upon being shot,and also the way he walked.of bigger concern,however is a scene very close to the end,where mr crazy bears a more than striking resemblance(actually a complete rip off)of another famous horror titan.and in the very last scenes,we have our scumbag,once again,looking exactly like the 1st horror icon i mentioned.in fact that last scene is almost a complete rip-off from another icon in the slasher genre. these scenes were weak and unoriginal(obviously).by the way,the movie is set in australia,so if you're a sucker for a chick with an aussie accent(like me)you'll be in heaven.if you not,than it just might grate on you.one other great thing about this movie:beautiful kylie minogoue(just don't get too attached to her)there is one non aussie accent,courtesy of molly ringwald.overall,there are more reasons to watch than not.i enjoyed it and had some fun.so,i have to give ""cut"" 8/10,which may seem too high to some people.	0
twelve years ago, production stopped on the slasher flick ""hot blooded"" since almost everyone on the set started dying. now, a couple of film students have decided to finish the film, despite the fact that there's a rumor that the film is cursed. well, they're about to find out that some curses are real.<br /><br />when scream was released, every country seemed to want to cash in on its success, even australia. the concept, which today has been done to death (a slasher film within a slasher film) was at the time relatively cool and original. this movie was released right before urban legends: final cut and scream 3 (well not in the us but in australia) so it felt like the first movie with this concept. when urban legends 2 was released, most of us had all ready grown sick of the concept and since the movie wasn't even good, the movie flopped disastrously. now, cut is not the best slasher flick ever, and nor does it try to be. it knows that it's a rip-off, and they even cast a girl who looks like a blonde version of neve campbell in the starring role. but instead of trying to add some new and original twists to the story, they've decided to rip-off some 80s slasher flicks like ""nightmare on elm street"" as well and surprisingly enough, this actually works. the killer is very creepy and that mask is just killer! and instead of trying to scare the audience to death, they've created a very good and creepy atmosphere which keeps us in suspense through most of the movie. there are a couple of plot holes in the movie though that i wasn't able to fully ignore, the ending being the biggest plot hole in the movie. spoiler ahead; i mean, they burnt the only copy of the movie so where the hell did they find the print that they show in the final scene? it makes no sense i tell you. end of spoilers. all in all, cut is a pretty creepy slasher flick with a silly story but i consider this to be one of the better scream rip-offs that never made it big. i'm surprised that this one never got a sequel, but i guess it simply came out too late. <br /><br />suspenseful australian slasher flick with very few scares. cut is still a pretty neat slasher movie and i will have to recommend this one even though i consider the story to be quite silly since it's completely ludicrous.	0
when i think of the cheesiest guilty pleasure-type movies, the first thing i think of are '80s slasher flicks. really bad slasher flicks. the formulaic type of film, where all a script needed was 2 parts blood and several parts nudity to get made.<br /><br />flash forward to the late '90s/early '00s. the slasher flick has been revitalized with the success of 1996's ""scream"". like in the '80s, these films were formulaic, masking a lack of inspiration by labelling themselves as ""hip, tongue-in-cheek parodies"" of the original slasher flicks. of this recent blend of ""hip parody"" neo-slasher flicks, the only one worth seeing is the low-budget, direct-to-video ""cut"".<br /><br />like most of the other ""new"" slasher flicks, ""cut"" relies on the production of a slasher flick, in this case a fictional 1985 film ""hot blooded"", to make its commentary on the genre. ""hot blooded"" never finished production, because of killings by someone wearing the mask of the film's killer, scarman, a bald figure with its mouth stitched close and dark, pupil-less eyes. now, 12 years later, a group of film students, whose professor was involved in the production, have decided to go into the vaults, tap the original surviving actress, and finish the film. but every time the film is screened or a scene is shot, ""scarman"" returns and someone dies. to quote the tagline, will they finish the film before it finishes them?<br /><br />this all sounds really bad, and to a degree it is (really, is there such a thing as a good slasher flick?). there is no character development (the ""new"" director is revealed to be the daughter of ""hot blooded""'s original director, whose life was apparently ruined after the production was cancelled; this would've been a perfect detail to be worked into the plot, yet it's never mentioned again) and, like in all other slasher flicks, there are just too many bodies to care about. the actors aren't great, even by direct-to-video standards, but most are having fun with their characters (and for those who aren't, it's inadvertent character acting, since none of their characters in the film wanted to work on ""hot blooded""), particularly whoever was lucky enough to play scarman. ""cut""'s climax has no big ""who dunnit"" unmasking of the killer like in the ""scream"" films. it doesn't have the gimmick killings of the ""urban legend"" films. what it does have is an original and interesting concept that is diluted by a ""this way we can write a sequel if it sells well"" ending. but that's par for the course.<br /><br />by any sensible viewing standards, this is a horrible movie that should be avoided, but this ""quality"" is what makes it true to its roots in the slasher genre, and this is what makes it more enjoyable than any of the other neo-slasher flicks.	0
a horror movie is being shot and things aren't going well. it's about a masked killer. the director tells off the killer in front of the cast and crew. he goes crazy and kills two people. he's killed himself and the film is never finished. twelve years later a bunch of film students decide to try and finish it--but there's a curse. people who try and finish it are killed themselves. the students ignore that. guess what happens next?<br /><br />the plot is old hat but this isn't bad...for what it is (a low budget slasher film). it's well-made with a young and fairly talented young cast. no one is great but no one is terrible either. it also avoids the obligatory (and needless) female nude scenes. it moves quickly, the gore is nice and bloody and the script doesn't insult your intelligence. also molly ringwald is in this having the time of her life playing a bitchy faded actress.<br /><br />no great shakes but not bad at all. i give it a 7.	0
this is one of those little christmas movies for everyone. our scrooge is ben affleck, who decides money is not enough, so he rents the family who lives where he thought his family did. ok? this is a great little high school soap, pg-13, but the small sex references are comedy, so if your kid can't handle them, they can't live in the real world, either.<br /><br />now, affleck is a hunk, and as usual walks through this fun, omg, remember when we did..., ensemble piece as if he were at the end stages of some neuroinfectious disease. but that's ok, because even this old oracle keeps hoping that if ben's that well proportioned all over, well, there's hope for us ladies yet. luckily, the rest of the ensemble--catharine o'hara, james gandolfini, christina applegate, udo kier and josh zuckerman--fill in and keep this shadow-side-ozzie-and-harriet christmas alternately hilarious, comfortable and warm.<br /><br />this movie is the kind you can jump up and get popcorn, and when you get back, everyone wants to back it up to show you what you missed.<br /><br />this is a happy film, after all, and it leaves you feeling good about life, love, family, christmas and chanel. there really is something for everyone.	0
what's with all the negative comments? after having seen this film for the first time tonight, i can only say that this is a good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely person's day. when i saw that drew (ben affleck) might end up spending the holidays alone, i wanted to cry. you'll have to see the movie if you want to know why. also, even though i liked tom (james gandolfini) and alicia (christina applegate) after awhile, if you ask me, they were real snobs. however, this film did make me smile and feel good inside. before i wrap this up, i'd like to say that mike mitchell has scored a pure holiday hit. now, in conclusion, i highly recommend this good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely person's day to any ben affleck or christina applegate fan who hasn't seen it.	0
cary grant and myrna loy are perfectly cast as a middle class couple who want to build the house of their dreams. it all starts out with reasonable plans and expectations, both of which are blown to bits by countless complications and an explosion of the original budget.<br /><br />there are many great laughs (even if the story is somewhat thin) sure to entertain fans of the stars or the late 1940s hollywood comedy style. a definite highlight comes when a contractor goes through a run down of all expenses, which must have sounded quite excessive to a 1948 audience. as he makes his exit, he assures the client (grant) that perhaps he could achieve a reduction of $100.00 from the total...or at least $50.00...but certainly $25.00. hilarious!	0
come on people. this movie is better than 4. i can see this happening...wealthy people have done crazier things than this. and it was funny.<br /><br />i watch a comedy to be entertained, escape from the pressures of the world for a short while, and not to have to take anything too seriously. this movie fully suits that purpose. i judge a movie on its own merits and am not about to compare surviving christmas to blazing saddles. i watched totally dysfunctional people grow into caring, likable individuals who could easily live down the street from my home. it will remain on my list of ""favorite.....must watch for the holiday season"". if you just want to have a fun 90 minutes, watch this one.	0
you can survive surviving christmas. i thought the television version was a bit edited way down. i like ben afleck. he plays drew johnson, a family-less adult, who is willing to pay complete strangers. the valcos starring james gandolfini and catherine o'hara as the parents and christina applegate as lisa valco, the daughter. drew is lonely around the holidays because he doesn't have a family of his own so he rents out a family in the chicago suburbs for a quarter million dollars. bill macy who i best remember for playing maude's husband arthur is hired to play duda, the grandfather. when the whole situation comes crashing down, the truth can be painful. the valcos household is crumbling apart from the drew situation. drew's rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprising visit. you can't buy what you wish for! the acting and writing is mediocre but the first rate cast pulls it through to the final scene.	0
what's not to like about this movie? every year you know that you're going to get one or two yule tide movies during christmas time and most of them are going to be terrible. this movie is definitely a fresh new idea that was pulled off pretty well. a very funny take on a rich young guy paying a family to simulate a real christmas for him. what is the good of having money like that if you can't do fun things with it. it was a win-win situation. a regular family gets six figures and a rich guy gets to experience christmas like he imagined. only if.<br /><br />drew latham (ben affleck) was incredibly difficult to deal with and it was just a riot to see the family reluctantly comply with his absurd demands. it was a fun and funny movie.	0
its a good thing i rented the movie before seeing the viewer rating from this site. it was a wonderful movie that i will be adding to my christmas selection. the cast was wonderfully chosen and ben affleck plays a good leading role. i would tell viewers who have not seen the movie to go ahead and buy it. i rate it right up there with christmas vacation. the movie was very funny and well written and ben plays the eccentric rich executive very well. the things he says and does is just how i would imagine a person with too much money to act. the movie is much funnier than the santa claus and christmas with the kranks. plus it has a good story line and teaches the true meaning of christmas which is you can't buy love with money.	0
i had some reservations about this movie, i figured it would be the usual bill of fare --- a formula movie about christmas. being in the middle of a heat wave in late june, we decided to give it a shot anyway, maybe we would see some snow.<br /><br />this movie turned out to be one laugh after another. ben affleck was believable in his character, but the real star of this one is james gandofini. he delivered his lines with a real wit about him and made a great ""dad"".<br /><br />if you want to have an enjoyable couple of hours, definitely check this one out.	0
surviving christmas is a surprisingly funny movie especially considering the bad publicity when it was first released. ben affleck is funny as an obnoxious millionaire who pays the family that occupies his childhood home to be his family for christmas. he then drives the family crazy with overindulgence for christmas cheer. i have not been a ben affleck fan in the past (though i did like daredevil and paycheck) but here he is well cast in this role. i also like christina applegate as the daughter in the family who can't stand affleck's character at first. sure you can see where this movie is going but you don't care. ignore what the critics say and rent this movie out because it is funnier than a lot of christmas movies.	0
at first i didn't think that ben affleck could really pull off a funny christmas movie,, boy was i wrong, my daughter invited me to watch this with her and i was not disappointed at all. james gandolfini was funny,, i really liked christina appelagate, and catherine o' hara was good too, the storyline is what really sold me,, i mean,, too put up with family,, at the table for people you only hardly see but once or twice a year,, and probably don't get along with anyway,, you really do need as much alcohol as you're system can stand to deal with christmas,, so i thought that the premise was good there, buying the family with 250000 dollars, was a little on the far fetched side,, but it turned out to work pretty good for me,, cause it was a riot all the way through, it shows the class struggle of the different families. it has lot's of funny moments, including embarrassing stuff on the computer for a teenage boy. all in all i loved this movie and will watch it again next christmas or sooner if my daughter wants too.	0
this movie isn't as bad as i heard. it was enjoyable, funny and i love that is revolves around the holiday season. it totally has me in the mood to christmas shop and listen to holiday music. when this movie comes out on dvd it will take the place of christmas vacation in my collection. it will be a movie to watch every year after thanksgiving to get me in the mood for the best time of the year. i heard that ben's character was a bit crazy but i think it just adds to the movie and why be so serious all the time. take it for what is it, a christmas comedy with a love twist. i enjoyed it. no, it isn't titanic and it won't make your heart pound with anticipation but it will bring on a laugh or two. so go laugh and have a good time:)	0
i laughed so hard during this movie my face hurt. ben affleck was hilarious and reminded me of a pretty boy jack black in this role. gandolfini gives his typical a performance. the entire cast is funny, the story pretty good and the comic moments awesome. i went into this movie not expecting much so perhaps that is why i was so surprised to come out of the flick thoroughly pleased and facially exhausted. i would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy, can identify with loneliness during the holidays and/or putting up with the relatives. the best part to this film (to me anyway) were the subtle bits of humor that caught me completely off guard and had me laughing long after the rest of the audience had stopped. namely, the scene involving the lighting of the christmas tree. go see it and have a good laugh!	0
this movie was made in 1948, but it still rings true today. very, very funny. it begins with a family wanting to buy a little place in the country and it ""builds"" from there. anyone who has ever built a house, will find this movie very endearing. great cast. cary grant and myrna lloyd are delightful in this film. this is a classic black and white film that reflects the grand style of the 40's....clothing, architecture and family life. many references are made to the cost of things, and those comparisons to today's costs are pretty amazing. i can't imagine anyone not enjoying this movie completely. i am surprised of the number of middle aged people who have never heard of it. a true classic.	0
`europa' (or, as it is also known, `zentropa') is one of the most visually stunning films i have ever seen. the blend of grayscale and colour photography is near seamless... a true feast for the eyes. the picture was a contender for a 1991's golden palm in canners. the award went to barton fink (by coen brothers); a film stylistically very similar to zentropa. here's an exercise in class: rent both films and be a judge for yourself.	0
this was a must see documentary for me when i missed the opportunity in 2004, so i was definitely going to watch the repeat. i really sympathised with the main character of the film, because, this is true, i have a milder condition of the skin problem he had, dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (eb). this is a sad, sometimes amusing and very emotional documentary about a boy with a terrible skin disorder. jonny kennedy speaks like a kid (because of wasting vocal muscle) and never went through puberty, but he is 36 years old. most sympathising moments are seeing his terrible condition, and pealing off his bandages. jonny had quite a naughty sense of humour, he even narrated from beyond the grave when showing his body in a coffin. he tells his story with the help of his mother, edna kennedy, his older brother and celebrity model, and jonny's supporter, nell mcandrew. it won the baftas for best editing and best new director (factual), and it was nominated for best sound (factual) and the flaherty documentary award. it was number 10 on the 100 greatest tv treats 2004. a must see documentary!	0
this is probably the best documentary i have seen in a very long time. jonny kennedy was and is still is a tragically beautiful inspiration. not only was he a survivor of one of the most painful diseases out there, but he used his beauty to show the world that there is life after death and never to give up reaching people and spreading his love. watching minutes of his life long struggle was heart-wrenching. listening to his smart ass remarks and seeing his adorable gestures was heartwarming. and seeing him smile was indescribable. i feel blessed to have been able to be touched by this tiny giant. please, if you ever have a chance to watch this film - consider yourself lucky to have met jonny kennedy.	0
i was greatly moved when i watched the movie.how jonny could keep such hope and faith was amazing. so many people only care about what they want , and fuss about all the things they don't have . and they are such small things ,like chothes,money a new car . i've seen people in tears because of a blemish. this movie brings everything back to the basics . love,hope the beauty of the simple but so important things in life.it makes our everyday problems seen for what they are small and really unimportant. you watch this boy and you realize as long as you have been blessed with food ,a roof over your head and your loved ones around you .you are truly blessed.and the saying stop and smell the roses truly has a new meaning.and i know jonny will see this and i want to thank him so much for sharing such faith,strenght,and humor with me .thank you jonny i know you soar the heavens and bring much love and laughter to the heavens above.	0
this man is nothing short of amazing. you truly feel as if you have lived his life with him throughout these tragic events, and cry along with his family in the end. he was so passionate about his cause, not just for himself, but to ensure others who will survive him do not have to go through this wretched pain. i watch this video every time i am having a bad or ""down"" day, and it always manages to make me see the great and brighter side of life, just like jonny did, even with his unbearable pain. my only regret is not knowing about jonny sooner, as i visited england 2 times during his life, and would have been able to say i'd met him. it is comforting to know jonny is sitting on his cloud, pain free! rest in peace, dear jonny. you deserve it!	0
the most moving and truly eye opening documentary ever created. i cried the whole way through, from start to end. watching the show you are immediately captured by a man's struggle to live without pain, to live a life we would take for granted. the first time i heard the title, i was almost scared to see the program, it was hard for me to comprehend living in agony every day of every year of my life. i truly felt for him. the saddest part of the documentary is when jonny picks out his coffin. could you imagine doing that? even more so, even though he was in excruciating and unbearable pain he still opened up his own charity. (debra)jonny is one of the only people that deserves true respect and admiration, he is the definition of a role model, what a true and undeniable hero he was!	0
in september 2003 36-year-old jonny kennedy died. he had a terrible genetic condition called dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (eb) - which meant that his skin literally fell off at the slightest touch, leaving his body covered in agonising sores and leading to a final fight against skin cancer. in his last months jonny decided to work with filmmaker patrick collerton to document his life and death, and the result was a film, first broadcast in march, that was an uplifting, confounding and provocatively humorous story of a singular man. not shying away from the grim reality of eb, the film was also a celebration of a life lived to the full. produced and directed by patrick collerton and first shown in march 2004 the boy whose skin fell off has become the most talked about documentary of that year. it attracted nearly five million viewers and after the screening the public donated over half a million pounds to jonny's charity, debra. a jonny kennedy memorial fund has been set up to raise another half a million with the aim of ensuring that jonny kennedy left a one million pound legacy.	0
i have a two year old son who suffers from the same condition as jonny kennedy. i never got the chance to meet him but i have never heard anybody say a bad word about him. i hope he knows how much the making of this programme has helped his fellow sufferers by raising awareness of this terrible condition. this man has touched people in a way that a million charity leaflets could not. i believe that this should be compulsory viewing in schools. i also agree with other comments - what have i got to moan about? he took everything that life could throw at him and still managed to retain a sense of humour. god bless. i couldn't watch the part that showed his dressings being changed. i have enough trouble with my son's.	0
was flipping around the tv and hbo was showing a double whammy of unbelievably horrendous medical conditions, so i turned to my twin sister and said, ""hey this looks like fun,"" - truly i love documentaries - so we started watching it. at first i thought jonni kennedy was a young man, but then it was explained that due to his condition, he never went through puberty, thus the high voice and smaller body. he was on a crusade to raise money for his cause. he had the most wonderful sense of humor combined with a beautiful sense of spirituality... i cried, watched some more, laughed, got up to get another kleenex, then cried some more. once jonni kennedy's ""time was up"" he flew to heaven to be with the angels. he was more than ready; he had learned his lessons from this life and he was free. i highly recommend this. if you do not fall in love with this guy, you have no heart.	0
i couldn't hold back the tears when i watched this beautiful documentary. it was heart-breaking, disturbing, and inspiring all in one. i recommend this documentary to anyone seeking something that will make them think about what they are doing with their own lives. or simply, something that will make you think. you watch as john lives through the last couple months of his life. you watch as he goes through his days with a positive attitude. at one point you begin to see that he is truly an amazing individual. you begin to understand that he has something to teach all of us. his life and struggles will make you cry, laugh, and find that life's a lot easier to live if you just take it one day at a time.	0
as with all of angelopoulos' films, ""the suspended step of the stork"" implicitly demands a close and intimate participation on the part of the viewer, a fact that has certainly contributed to the limited popularity of his work. dialogues are sparing, with no monologues or exchanges exteriorizing the characters' inner conflicts, doubts, or feelings. the filmmaker prefers to keep the viewers away from their own emotional responses, and instead forces them to explore and study the characters' identities for themselves. as a result, the acting is understated and implicit, as opposed to overt and explicit.<br /><br />the action scenes are set between long intervals of contemplation, where the viewer is asked to become a participant, to participate as an actor, by probing his or her own psyche. as in a novel, where the drama rests entirely on the author's writing to provide a template where the reader's imagination and/or past experience flourish, angelopoulos' drama rests within his images: his uses of the long shots, the long takes, the leisurely pacing, the sparing dialogues that have become his trademark, inviting the viewer to experience the film from his or her personal perspective. angelopoulos uses silence to capture moments of high intensity, reverting to the non-verbal language of gestures, gazes, sounds, and music, when he believes that words can only take us so far.<br /><br />the music, by angelopoulos' long time collaborator, eleni karaindrou, provides more than just a discreet background, but becomes itself a dramatic element of the story. a large part of the film consists of exterior shots in subtle, subdued colors, recorded in a drab winter light. angelopoulos presents us with an ""other greece,"" one far different from the greece of the tourist brochures, with ethereal blue skies and emerald seas, drowned in an eternal sunshine. here, the skies are covered and gray, the air is cold and misty, and the sands of the pristine beaches have been replaced by the trampled, dirty snow of the village streets. angelopoulos' genius through arvanitis' camera is on display throughout the film.<br /><br />""the suspended step of the stork"" is above all else a political statement aimed at the socio-political situation in the balkans at the end of the twentieth century. it is deeply concerned with the meaning of ""borders,"" and with those who are the victims of the confusion between nations. in the ""waiting room"" facing the albanian border, the refugees, political or other, outcast by the rest of humanity, wait. they may be stuck against a political border, but unfortunately they still carry with them, and hang on, deeper ancestral borders: those of the languages, of the customs, and of the races. although angelopoulos' political views are well known, the film steers clear of any political discourse regarding the causes of the refugees' plights. in the process, angelopoulos forces us to meditate on the concepts of geographical, cultural, political, and personal ""borders."" <br /><br />angelopoulos considers himself a historian of twentieth century greece, and he likes to bring lessons from the hellenic myths into his discussions. in this film, he does some border crossing himself between the greek and italian cultures, drawing from a combined homeric and dantesque tradition of odysseus' travel. alexander is a telemachus, in search of a story about an aging greek politician/odysseus who disappeared, never to be heard of again. this political man, a brilliant orator, unexpectedly and inexplicably left the comfort of his bourgeois existence, his wife, and his brilliant career, to live anonymously in a refugee camp with the lowest of the low. he became a poet in exile wondering how to change the world. of course, the ""politician"" is not alexander's father, but the ""politician"" stands before alexander like a father figure/odysseus. as with homer's telemachus, alexander grows as a person during his odyssey.<br /><br />of course, it would be wrong to try and see in the film a retelling of homer's odyssey in a contemporary context. angelopoulos draws on odysseus's travels only as structuring and thematic elements for his film. in angelopoulos' ending, ""odysseus"" is more like the dante's odysseus: he does not leave for ithaca but goes on, ""carrying a suitcase."" and alexander/telemachus is ""suspended"" between returning to his home and his career, or embarking on a voyage to ""somewhere else."" he states as much, in a voice-over at the beginning of the film, paraphrasing few lines from dante's ""inferno"": ""and don't forget that the time for a voyage has come again. the wind blows your eyes far away."" <br /><br />finally, although angelopoulos is not a religious person, there is a greek orthodox religious theme introduced during the film in the form of the yellow-suited linesmen, who go around bettering things for their fellow human beings by reconnecting communications, and also the christ-like figure of the ""politician."" in the final scene, these men in yellow demonstrate once more the byzantine iconography's influence in angelopoulos' work. they appear like ""stylites,"" religious figures found in the orthodox tradition, solitary and fervent men who took up their abode upon the tops of pillars, in a form of asceticism.<br /><br />the film ends without a resolution as to the true identity of the character played by mastroianni. angelopoulos does not give us any clues, and the wife's statement, ""it's not him,"" is far from convincing and left ambiguous enough. the important question of the film is not whether he is or is not the vanished politician, but that he could be the politician. but the film still ends on an optimistic note. whereas the wires strung from pole to pole run only along the river, and thus communications across the border are still not possible, and it remains impenetrable, we note that this final scene is taken from a point of view across the river: the camera has crossed the border, and the reverse tracking shot is inviting alexander and the viewer to follow beyond the boundary. on this account, angelopoulos gives us hope that somehow, some of the borders will eventually crumble.	0
one of cary grant's most enduring comedies is mr. blandings builds his dream house. although judging by the size of it the dwelling would be a dream mansion today. still cary was making a good living in the advertising field even though he was having a devil of a time trying to come up with a slogan for ham with the brand name of wham.<br /><br />what made this film so popular was the housing shortage of the post world war ii years. returning veterans from the war were claiming their entitlements under the gi bill of rights which included home loans. the problem was there literally were not enough houses to satisfy the demand. around the time the book by eric hodgins and the film were so popular congress passed and president truman signed the taft-ellender- wagner housing law which put the government for the first time in the home building business.<br /><br />i had an uncle and aunt who were around the same time building their own home which they moved into in the early fifties. like cary grant and myrna loy they had two daughters and were looking to get out of inner city rochester. their place wasn't quite as grand as a house in connecticut with eighteen rooms, still they lived there the rest of their lives the way cary and myrna most likely did.<br /><br />of course it was expensive and the costs just keep adding up and up, threatening to send cary to the cleaners. cary and myrna also have melvyn douglas around to offer counsel, usually too late. truth be told he's kind of sweet on myrna and cary knows it.<br /><br />myrna loy's role is simply an extension of nora charles. if you can imagine the charles's moving to the country and william powell having the headaches cary grant does, the film would still work just fine.<br /><br />mr. blandings builds his dream house still works well as comedy because the situations are universal. and this review is dedicated to my uncle walter and aunt kate who lived in their dream house together for over 40 years.	0
a most recommendable masterpiece, not only for the underlying themes of the story but also for the unmatchably brilliant and ingenious picture work of angelopoulos, not to mention the acting of giants, mastroianni and moreau, and the remarkable character play by ilias logothethis. gregory karr's performance may seem overshadowed by his ""tough"" partners' at first stance but in fact he perfectly plays his character, which is revealed in his very last scene with the girl (khrysikou) and the man (mastroianni), albeit hinted beforehand. (hence the spoiler.)<br /><br />get your expectations straight! it's an ""art movie"" in whatever meaning that phrase has to offer and requires attention. not for spending free time, but for watching an artwork with the necessary concentration as in reading a book or attending a concert. due to the overall photographic style, large screen viewing is recommended.<br /><br />dialogues are used sparingly. but the film includes -in addition to the standard greek and english speaking- fragments spoken in albanian, kurdish and turkish, which will be attractive for those who are charmed by the beauty in hearing various languages.	0
enjoyed this 1936 film with plenty of veteran classic actors and especially, william powell, (dr. lawrence bradford), ""mister roberts"", who played the role as a doctor and detective. dr. bradford was once married to jean arthur, (paula bradford), ""shane"", and got a divorce and still they managed to live with each other and also fight all the time. paula wanted her husband to investigate a homicide and did everything she could to convince him it was very important. jean arthur plays a rather nutty type and there is plenty of 1936 comedy and the method of murder is something you will never believe, especially with a jockey on a california race track. robert armstrong, (nick martel) ""king kong"" gave a great supporting role as a bookie along with james gleason, a detective who need the help of dr. bradford in order to solve this very strange murder mystery. if you see this film, just remember it was produced and directed in 1936 and the people in the audience in those days thought this was great entertainment and it really was in those days!	0
""the ex-mrs. bradford"" (1936), starring thin man series star william powell (this film was released the same year as the second thin man film, ""after the thin man,"" comes very close to duplicating the fun and style of the thin man films, but it nonetheless misses. still, it is a wonderfully fun, highly entertaining murder mystery in the same comic vein.<br /><br />is myrna loy missed? of course, let's not lie. however, i'd be hard-pressed to name a better substitute than jean arthur. and the chemistry between arthur and co-star william powell is real and it's fun, romantic and involving.<br /><br />the story and screenplay by anthonyu vieller and john wyne's production company partner, james edward grant (""the angel & the bad man"") is close to being up there with a thin man effort, but lacks a bit of the proper wit and sizzle.<br /><br />while it's not in the stratosphere of 'the thin man"" movies (what else is?), ""the ex-mrs. bradford"" is one of the most entertaining of the dozens and dozens of mystery-comedy ""who-done-its"" of the '30s & 40s.	0
i've seen the thin man series -- powell and loy are definitely great, but there is something awfully sweet about powell and arthur's chemistry in this flick. jean arthur shines when she looks at powell. there is an unmistakable undercurrent buzzing between them. this film may not have the wit of the thin man series, but undeniably makes up for it in charm. while i watched it, i thought for sure powell was carrying on an off-screen affair with arthur. my friends thought the same. this is one film where i wish i could step back in time (to schmooze and lock lips with powell!) there seems to be no end to his lovable playful smirks! powell's character, lawrence bradford, is probably the closest thing to the ""perfect man."" okay, this is sounding way too gushy, but i can't help myself.	0
rko studios decided to borrow both william powell from mgm and jean arthur from columbia, for one of their more big budget efforts to cash in on the popularity of the thin man. they succeeded to some degree.<br /><br />a lot of folks forget that in addition to and earlier than nick charles, bill powell also played in a few philo vance films in the title role. so by this time he was pretty well set in the role. doctor bradford is not doing as many liquid lunches as nick charles, but the basic blasé nick is still there. one difference is that while nick charles married an heiress, doctor bradford works for a living as a physician. that helps in his avocation of detective and in fact it does in this film.<br /><br />he's got two murders to solve. a jockey falls off a horse coming into the homestretch of a big race and dies for no apparent reason. the trainer suspects something afoot, but he's bumped off by the more conventional method of a bullet. this is after he comes to bill powell for help.<br /><br />myrna loy was a more steadying influence on bill powell than jean arthur was. arthur plays it as more of a dizzy dame than loy did. but it works here and she and powell have good chemistry.<br /><br />the ever dependable james gleason is the police inspector in the sam levene/nat pendleton role. all they needed here was asta and possibly eric blore as powell's butler was essaying that part.<br /><br />if powell and arthur were signed at this studio we might have seen a whole slew of bradford films.	0
the comic banter between william powell and jean arthur is the highlight of this murder mystery, which has one of the most bizarre and unlikely plots ever. powell is probably the most suave detective of the 30's, and arthur has a unique voice which often sounds like a succession of tiny tinkly bells. they are extremely fun to watch, so take the brashness of the plot with a grain of salt and just enjoy seeing it unfold. eric blore also has some comic turns as powell's butler.<br /><br />powell's contract with mgm included a clause which allowed him to reject being loaned out to another studio, but he wanted to work again with arthur and he liked the script, so he eagerly accepted the assignment. they had worked together in two 1929 paramount films, the canary murder case and the greene murder case, both in the philo vance series.	0
i have just managed to get hold of the celestial region 3 dvd of the five venoms and what a super job they have made of it. a fantastic digitally remastered transfer and a must have for any kung fu fan.<br /><br />the story is pretty straight forward, and has been mentioned already so i won't go into it again. needless to say it's the fight scenes that many buy the movie for, and they do not disappoint. only problem is they are a bit few and far between and seem over rehearsed. bruce lee could take these lot on and drink a cup of tea at the same time! all kicks and punches come with the all important ""type writer"" clicks and air ""whooshes"", which is a cool effect though quite amusing!<br /><br />i give this movie a b+. good but not great. in a way i feel it could have been that bit better. golden swallow, by the same director a decade earlier, had as good a story and better action.	0
story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig. starts out with a opening scene that is a terrific example of absurd comedy. a formal orchestra audience is turned into an insane, violent mob by the crazy chantings of it's singers. unfortunately it stays absurd the whole time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting. even those from the era should be turned off. the cryptic dialogue would make shakespeare seem easy to a third grader. on a technical level it's better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great vilmos zsigmond. future stars sally kirkland and frederic forrest can be seen briefly.	1
airport '77 starts as a brand new luxury 747 plane is loaded up with valuable paintings & such belonging to rich businessman philip stevens (james stewart) who is flying them & a bunch of vip's to his estate in preparation of it being opened to the public as a museum, also on board is stevens daughter julie (kathleen quinlan) & her son. the luxury jetliner takes off as planned but mid-air the plane is hi-jacked by the co-pilot chambers (robert foxworth) & his two accomplice's banker (monte markham) & wilson (michael pataki) who knock the passengers & crew out with sleeping gas, they plan to steal the valuable cargo & land on a disused plane strip on an isolated island but while making his descent chambers almost hits an oil rig in the ocean & loses control of the plane sending it crashing into the sea where it sinks to the bottom right bang in the middle of the bermuda triangle. with air in short supply, water leaking in & having flown over 200 miles off course the problems mount for the survivor's as they await help with time fast running out...<br /><br />also known under the slightly different tile airport 1977 this second sequel to the smash-hit disaster thriller airport (1970) was directed by jerry jameson & while once again like it's predecessors i can't say airport '77 is any sort of forgotten classic it is entertaining although not necessarily for the right reasons. out of the three airport films i have seen so far i actually liked this one the best, just. it has my favourite plot of the three with a nice mid-air hi-jacking & then the crashing (didn't he see the oil rig?) & sinking of the 747 (maybe the makers were trying to cross the original airport with another popular disaster flick of the period the poseidon adventure (1972)) & submerged is where it stays until the end with a stark dilemma facing those trapped inside, either suffocate when the air runs out or drown as the 747 floods or if any of the doors are opened & it's a decent idea that could have made for a great little disaster flick but bad unsympathetic character's, dull dialogue, lethargic set-pieces & a real lack of danger or suspense or tension means this is a missed opportunity. while the rather sluggish plot keeps one entertained for 108 odd minutes not that much happens after the plane sinks & there's not as much urgency as i thought there should have been. even when the navy become involved things don't pick up that much with a few shots of huge ships & helicopters flying about but there's just something lacking here. george kennedy as the jinxed airline worker joe patroni is back but only gets a couple of scenes & barely even says anything preferring to just look worried in the background.<br /><br />the home video & theatrical version of airport '77 run 108 minutes while the us tv versions add an extra hour of footage including a new opening credits sequence, many more scenes with george kennedy as patroni, flashbacks to flesh out character's, longer rescue scenes & the discovery or another couple of dead bodies including the navigator. while i would like to see this extra footage i am not sure i could sit through a near three hour cut of airport '77. as expected the film has dated badly with horrible fashions & interior design choices, i will say no more other than the toy plane model effects aren't great either. along with the other two airport sequels this takes pride of place in the razzie award's hall of shame although i can think of lots of worse films than this so i reckon that's a little harsh. the action scenes are a little dull unfortunately, the pace is slow & not much excitement or tension is generated which is a shame as i reckon this could have been a pretty good film if made properly.<br /><br />the production values are alright if nothing spectacular. the acting isn't great, two time oscar winner jack lemmon has said since it was a mistake to star in this, one time oscar winner james stewart looks old & frail, also one time oscar winner lee grant looks drunk while sir christopher lee is given little to do & there are plenty of other familiar faces to look out for too.<br /><br />airport '77 is the most disaster orientated of the three airport films so far & i liked the ideas behind it even if they were a bit silly, the production & bland direction doesn't help though & a film about a sunken plane just shouldn't be this boring or lethargic. followed by the concorde ... airport '79 (1979).	1
this film lacked something i couldn't put my finger on at first: charisma on the part of the leading actress. this inevitably translated to lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading man. even the romantic scenes came across as being merely the actors at play. it could very well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors. i just don't know.<br /><br />but could it have been the screenplay? just exactly who was the chef in love with? he seemed more enamored of his culinary skills and restaurant, and ultimately of himself and his youthful exploits, than of anybody or anything else. he never convinced me he was in love with the princess.<br /><br />i was disappointed in this movie. but, don't forget it was nominated for an oscar, so judge for yourself.	1
sorry everyone,,, i know this is supposed to be an ""art"" film,, but wow, they should have handed out guns at the screening so people could blow their brains out and not watch. although the scene design and photographic direction was excellent, this story is too painful to watch. the absence of a sound track was brutal. the loooonnnnng shots were too long. how long can you watch two people just sitting there and talking? especially when the dialogue is two people complaining. i really had a hard time just getting through this film. the performances were excellent, but how much of that dark, sombre, uninspired, stuff can you take? the only thing i liked was maureen stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene. otherwise this was a ripoff of bergman. and i'm no fan f his either. i think anyone who says they enjoyed 1 1/2 hours of this is,, well, lying.	1
when i was little my parents took me along to the theater to see interiors. it was one of many movies i watched with my parents, but this was the only one we walked out of. since then i had never seen interiors until just recently, and i could have lived out the rest of my life without it. what a pretentious, ponderous, and painfully boring piece of 70's wine and cheese tripe. woody allen is one of my favorite directors but interiors is by far the worst piece of crap of his career. in the unmistakable style of ingmar berman, allen gives us a dark, angular, muted, insight in to the lives of a family wrought by the psychological damage caused by divorce, estrangement, career, love, non-love, halitosis, whatever. the film, intentionally, has no comic relief, no music, and is drenched in shadowy pathos. this film style can be best defined as expressionist in nature, using an improvisational method of dialogue to illicit a ""more pronounced depth of meaning and truth"". but woody allen is no ingmar bergman. the film is painfully slow and dull. but beyond that, i simply had no connection with or sympathy for any of the characters. instead i felt only contempt for this parade of shuffling, whining, nicotine stained, martyrs in a perpetual quest for identity. amid a backdrop of cosmopolitan affluence and baked brie intelligentsia the story looms like a fart in the room. everyone speaks in affected platitudes and elevated language between cigarettes. everyone is ""lost"" and ""struggling"", desperate to find direction or understanding or whatever and it just goes on and on to the point where you just want to slap all of them. it's never about resolution, it's only about interminable introspective babble. it is nothing more than a psychological drama taken to an extreme beyond the audience's ability to connect. woody allen chose to make characters so immersed in themselves we feel left out. and for that reason i found this movie painfully self indulgent and spiritually draining. i see what he was going for but his insistence on promoting his message through prozac prose and distorted film techniques jettisons it past the point of relevance. i highly recommend this one if you're feeling a little too happy and need something to remind you of death. otherwise, let's just pretend this film never happened.	1
""it appears that many critics find the idea of a woody allen drama unpalatable."" and for good reason: they are unbearably wooden and pretentious imitations of bergman. and let's not kid ourselves: critics were mostly supportive of allen's bergman pretensions, allen's whining accusations to the contrary notwithstanding. what i don't get is this: why was allen generally applauded for his originality in imitating bergman, but the contemporaneous brian depalma was excoriated for ""ripping off"" hitchcock in his suspense/horror films? in robin wood's view, it's a strange form of cultural snobbery. i would have to agree with that.	1
the second attempt by a new york intellectual in less than 10 years to make a ""swedish"" film - the first being susan sontag's ""brother carl"" (which was made in sweden, with swedish actors, no less!) the results? oscar wilde said it best, in reference to dickens' ""the old curiosity shop"": ""one would have to have a heart of stone not to laugh out loud at the death of little nell."" pretty much the same thing here. ""interiors"" is chock full of solemnly intoned howlers. (""i'm afraid of my anger."" looking into the middle distance: ""i don't like who i'm becoming."") the directorial quotations (to use a polite term) from bergman are close to parody. the incredibly self-involved family keep reminding us of how brilliant and talented they are, to the point of strangulation. (""i read a poem of yours the other day. it was in - i don't know - the new yorker."" ""oh. that was an old poem. i reworked it."") far from not caring about these people, however, i found them quite hilarious. much of the dialog is exactly like the funny stuff from allen's earlier films - only he's directed his actors to play the lines straight. having not cast himself in the movie, he has poor mary beth hurt copy all of his thespian tics, intonations, and neurotic habits, turning her into an embarrassing surrogate (much like kenneth branagh in ""celebrity"").<br /><br />the basic plot - dysfunctional family with quietly domineering mother - seems to be lifted more or less from bergman's ""winter light,"" the basic family melodrama tricked up with a lot of existential angst. it all comes through in the shopworn visual/aural tricks: the deafening scratching of a pencil on paper, the towering surf that dwarfs the people walking on the beach. etc, etc.<br /><br />allen's later ""serious"" films are less embarrassing, but also far less entertaining. i'll take ""interiors."" woody's rarely made a funnier movie.	1
i don't know who to blame, the timid writers or the clueless director. it seemed to be one of those movies where so much was paid to the stars (angie, charlie, denise, rosanna and jon) that there wasn't enough left to really make a movie. this could have been very entertaining, but there was a veil of timidity, even cowardice, that hung over each scene. since it got an r rating anyway why was the ubiquitous bubble bath scene shot with a 70-year-old woman and not angie harmon? why does sheen sleepwalk through potentially hot relationships with two of the most beautiful and sexy actresses in the world? if they were only looking for laughs why not cast whoopi goldberg and judy tenuta instead? this was so predictable i was surprised to find that the director wasn't a five year old. what a waste, not just for the viewers but for the actors as well.	1
this film is mediocre at best. angie harmon is as funny as a bag of hammers. her bitchy demeanor from ""law and order"" carries over in a failed attempt at comedy. charlie sheen is the only one to come out unscathed in this horrible anti-comedy. the only positive thing to come out of this mess is charlie and denise's marriage. hopefully that effort produces better results.	1
the film is bad. there is no other way to say it. the story is weak and outdated, especially for this country. i don't think most people know what a ""walker"" is or will really care. i felt as if i was watching a movie from the 70's. the subject was just not believable for the year 2007, even being set in dc. i think this rang true for everyone else who watched it too as the applause were low and quick at the end. most didn't stay for the q&a either.<br /><br />i don't think schrader really thought the film out ahead of time. many of the scenes seemed to be cut short as if they were never finished or he just didn't know how to finish them. he jumped from one scene to the next and you had to try and figure out or guess what was going on. i really didn't get woody's (carter) private life or boyfriend either. what were all the ""artistic"" male bondage and torture pictures (from iraq prisons) about? what was he thinking? i think it was his very poor attempt at trying to create this dark private subculture life for woody's character (car). it didn't work. it didn't even seem to make sense really.<br /><br />the only good thing about this film was woody harrelson. he played his character (car) flawlessly. you really did get a great sense of what a ""walker"" may have been like (say twenty years ago). he was great and most likely will never get recognized for it. <br /><br />as for lauren, lily and kristin... boring.<br /><br />don't see it! it is painful! unless you are a true harrelson fan.	1
this film is one giant pant load. paul schrader is utterly lost in his own bad screenplay. and his directing is about as comatose as it can be without his actually having been sleepwalking during the process. <br /><br />the worst though is woody harrelson, whom i ordinarily like when he's properly cast. he plays ""the walker"", a homosexual man in d.c. who plays social companion to the bored wives of the washington elite. he couldn't have been more one dimensional if he had been cut out of a magazine and bounced around in front of the camera on a popsicle stick. his ""southern accent"" is that ""off the rack"" version that decrescendos from the beginning to the end of every line he delivers, as though the heat and humidity of the south is still draining him of every ounce of energy he has. it is monotonous. but, his is not the worst accent in the movie. his ""boyfriend"", played by moritz bleibtreau, attempts to affect some kind of a mid east accent that is so clumsy he can barely deliver the bad lines written for him. he is incapable of rolling his r's in spite of the fact that in real life he is german, and speaks several languages - one of them being italian! that's kind of a good reason to cast someone else don't ya think? <br /><br />from the story, to the screenplay, to the directing, to the camera work, to the performances by the leads, this movie is bad from beginning to end. the only tolerable moments in this film came from three supporting actresses: lily tomlin, lauren bacall, and kristin scott thomas. only these three managed to make it through this movie with their dignity in tact. in fact, all three are excellent, in spite of being trapped in a really bad film. ufortunately, no one could ever be good enough to redeem this endless series of flaws. if you like these three actresses, watch them in something else. this movie is not worth your time.	1
the plot for descent, if it actually can be called a plot, has two noteworthy events. one near the beginning - one at the end. together these events make up maybe 5% of the total movie time. everything (and i mean _everything_) in between is basically the director's desperate effort to fill in the minutes. i like disturbing movies, i like dark movies and i don't get troubled by gritty scenes - but if you expect me to sit through 60 minutes of hazy/dark (literally) scenes with no storyline you have another thing coming. rosario dawson, one of my favorite actresses is completely wasted here. and no, she doesn't get naked, not even in the nc-17 version, which i saw.<br /><br />if you have a couple of hours to throw away and want to watch ""descent"", take a nap instead - you'll probably have more interesting dreams.	1
plot is not worth discussion even if it hints at corruption, murder, power and the rest of thriller related topics. characters are interesting though sometimes. not realistic but interesting nevertheless.<br /><br />development is slow like tea drinking ceremony. visuals not stunning, but good enough to ease the eye strain. good movie to watch after dinner before going to bed - nothing shocking too much, nothing overexciting. movie sitcom style.<br /><br />i liked woody - excellent performance. had to fight the plot inadequacy and did the job pretty good. the rest are bearable though very predictable. the whole is watchable and better than most tv shows.	1
this film is about a male escort getting involved in a murder investigation that happened in the circle of powerful men's wives.<br /><br />i thought ""the walker"" would be thrilling and engaging, but i was so wrong. the pacing is painfully and excruciatingly slow, that even after 40 minutes of the film nothing happens much. seriously, the first hour could be condensed into ten minutes. that's how slow it is.<br /><br />the fact that it lacks any thrills or action scenes aggravates the boredom. it's almost shocking that even argument scenes are so plain and devoid of emotion. maybe it is because of the stiff upper lip of the higher social class? <br /><br />it's sad that ""the walker"" becomes such a boring mess, despite such a strong cast. blame it on the poor plot and even worse pacing.	1
this movie must be in line for the most boring movie in years. not even woody harrison can save this movie from sinking to the bottom.<br /><br />the murder in this movie are supposed to be the point of interest in this movie but is not, nothing is of any interest. the cast are not to bad but the script are just plain awful , i just sat in utter amazement during this movie, thinking how on earth can anyone find this movie entertaining <br /><br />the producers of this movie were very clever. they made a boring movie but hid it well with the names of good actors and actresses on their cast. people will go to the blockbuster and probably see this movie and think, woody harrison ,kristin scott thomas and willem dafoe this must be good and rent this movie.(boy are they in for a horrible time)<br /><br />if you like getting ripped off go and rent this movie, some people actually did enjoyed this movie but i like to w"	1
"this is available on a ""drive in double feature"" from dark sky films, and since i just had finished up ""barracuda"", i watched this too. this is a film that proves to be incredibly ambitious and inept at the same time.<br /><br />we begin with two young ladies wandering the streets of some foreign town, but where exactly are they? they stop to look at necklaces from some chinese vendor, and try on chinese-style clothes at a shop, but then we see some aztec dancers? and all the while, these girls are being followed by two guys, who eventually drop whatever stealth they didn't have to chase the girls on a wild run though the town, and they finally catch them.<br /><br />it seems that one of the girls has a coin on a string around her neck, and these guys want to find the loot, and where did she get it? so, in flashback, we go back to find out. and how did they know she had this coin? hard to say, really.<br /><br />now, back in the day, when these two women were 10 years old, they were out with their sisters and their sister's boyfriends on a boat, and after stopped to get air in their tanks, they tow this young boy back to his home dock, only to have his grandpa come out & invite the ""young 'uns"" up for herbal tea with granny. but not everyone has the tea, todd has gone back to the boat to check on the young girls, and then when they're away from it, the boat blows up, and when they get back to the house their friends have mysteriously disappeared. well, it seems as though these ""kindly folk"" raise their own vegetables but they wait for the meat to drop by for a spell, and serve it herbal tea.<br /><br />but the girls and todd did leave the island, but now, they're returning, escorted by their captors, and they're there to find the treasure, despite the fact that no one ever showed the girls where it was before. there also seems to be someone else on the island, and the thugs mysteriously begin to die, one by one, and since there's only three, it doesn't take long. and there's even a sort of happy ending, which will leave the viewer every bit as baffled as they were throughout the rest of the film.<br /><br />the two thugs seem to be speed freaks with anger issues, and combined with no acting ability they're borderline hilarious. the hillbilly-type family is also devoid of acting ability, despite the fact that the grandpa is hank worden, who appeared in many films and tv shows. the action is confusing, the locales are even more confusing, and the island looks like southern california.<br /><br />so what the hell is this? i'm not sure, but it certainly is worth seeing once so you can think (or say), huh? 4 out of 10, very bizarre."	1
"this really should deserve a ""o"" rating, or even a negative ten. i watched this show for ages, and the show jumped the shark around series 7. this episode, however, is proof that the show has jumped the shark. it's writing is lazy, absurd, self-indulgent and not even worthy of rubbish like beavis and butthead.<br /><br />it is quite possible to be ridiculous and still be fun -- pirates of the caribbean, the mummy, count of monte cristo -- all ""fun"" movies that are not to be taken seriously. however, there is such thing as ridiculous as in ""this is the worst thing i've ever seen."" and indeed, this is the worst episode of stargate i've ever seen. it's absolutely dreadful, and this coming from someone with a stargate in her basement.<br /><br />makes me want to sell all of my stargate props, most seriously."	1
"i don't remember the last time i reacted to a performance as emotionally as i did to justin timberlake's in ""edison."" i got so emotional i wanted to scream in anguish, destroy the screen, readily accept the hopeless cries of nihilism. timberlake is horribly miscast; in fact, casting him is like casting andy dick to play the lead role in ""patton,"" or nathan lane to play jesus. but that is almost beside the point.<br /><br />timberlake is simply a bad actor and he would be equally terrible in any role. i used to have problems with ben affleck's acting talent, but timberlake makes affleck look like sir ian mckellen or dame judi dench. with his metrosexual lisp (read lithp), his boyish glances and emotional expressions which derive from something like ""the 25 cliché expressions for actors,"" he poisons the screen upon which he is inflicted mercilessly, and no matter how you slice it, i do not and will not buy his role as an amateur-turned-crusader-for-justice journalist. it simply will not fly.<br /><br />however, timberlake alone isn't to blame for his failure. director david j. burke puts him not only in the (essentially) primary role, but also places him aside morgan freeman, kevin spacey, john heard, dylan mcdermott, cary elwes and (i'm surprised he was as good) ll cool j. i can imagine one almost physically suffering watching some of this cast interact with timberlake.<br /><br />there is an upside to this of course: the moment any of these actors interact without justin there it feels like a double relief. a pleasure, if you will. freeman and spacey may not have more than 10 minutes of screen time alone together, but that ten minutes is blissful in contrast to their scenes with our so-called hero. dylan mcdermott is also a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />but enough of timberlake bashing - words aren't enough in this particular case to do the trick. ""edison"" is a very, very run-of-the-mill corruption story. it's plot ranges from cliché to simply preposterous. i do, however, admire the motivation behind making it, which i interpret as an homage to films like ""serpico,"" or ""donnie brasco,"" or maybe even ""chinatown."" don't get me wrong - ""edison"" is not even in the same ballpark as these films, but i can stretch my suspension of disbelief to admire its reason for existence, perhaps to justify my sitting through it.<br /><br />the script, in and of itself, features some surprisingly bad writing. yes, it has some decent interchanges, but any conversation between piper perabo (who is wasted here) and timberlake seems like it was lifted straight out of a dawson's creek episode. it's your typical far-too-glib-for-reality, let's-impress-the-audience-with-how-well-we-articulate (and fail) dialogue. this dialogue, mind you, is punctuated by great music at the wrong moments - sometimes it feels like ""edison"" wants to morph into a music video, where the emotion of the scene is not communicated through acting, but precisely through the badly chosen music and variant film speeds (read slow-motion).<br /><br />thinking about it, ""edison"" is a curiosity. it's sure as hell got a cast to kill for but the performances are marred by timberlake who simply doesn't work. in film as in most art, if one thing is off, the whole thing feels off. directors must make tough choices. david j. burke missed the mark here. some of the scenes play well in and of themselves, but as a whole, they don't seem to fit like puzzle pieces from different puzzles forced into one incoherent picture. and it's not particularly an exciting puzzle to begin with."	1
"i bought bloodsuckers on ebay a while ago. i watched parts and deemed it just too dumb to review again. the excessive amount of watery 'blood' at the beginning is just plain obsolete - not to mention the ""whip-around"" wind sounds. my friends and i made a super low budget movie, and the effects still exceeded this crap fest.<br /><br />as for the amount of mistakes in this movie, there are way too many to count. i knew one of the actors - believe it or not, he was my theatre teacher. ha! <br /><br />final verdict: don't bother with this ""horror"" flick. <br /><br />3 stars (out of a possible 73)"	1
"80 minutes, and it felt twice that long! brief crossing is not brief enough. indeed, the first 50 minutes or so consist almost entirely of a dialogue (more of a monologue, really) of a woman approaching middle age, tediously droning about ""men,"" disappointment, sex, aging, and her recent breakup, to a french teenager she met in the ship's cafeteria.<br /><br />the tedious monologue continues as they go to duty-free shop, and to a bar, where finally her self-involved rant pushes him away. the ""story"" can't end there, of course, so she persuades him to listen to her drone on more as she brings him to her cabin.<br /><br />what little romance, sex, or for that matter, anything at all this film has besides bitter rantings is hardly enough to justify the price of a rental unless you are one of those who love dramas where nothing interesting happens at all. yes, the ending is very nicely done, but it is scant reward to subject yourself to what amounts to a turning your living room into a virtual therapy session with a narcissistic whiner.<br /><br />of course, some people like it. i could be wrong."	1
it has its merit's; morvern callar is both the merits and the disappointments. she's so enigmatic, so original. is it her method of dealing with the pain of a lost one that's making her so distant and un-relatable? or is she as one reviewer called her a revolutionary? personally i'd call her dysfunctional.<br /><br />morvern is completely detaching herself. disposing of her boyfriend, not thinking of informing family or using the money he gave her for a proper funeral, she selfishly splashes out on a trip to spain. she's seems so devoid of anything relatively human bar greed. the only element that enables the audience see the human side of her is her close friend she takes on holiday with her. although by the end her friend is dumped and morvern has nothing that ties her down to humanity. she may as well have killed herself.<br /><br />despite managing to make spain look as gloomy and bland as the uk the director's shots were superb, the lighting and color made the film visually stunning.<br /><br />it's really a shame the movie has nothing in it that keeps interest. it's little over 90 minutes but feels a lot longer. they manage to make morvern seem interesting to grab your attention but do nothing with her only alienate her from you more to the point where you don't care about the characters or the film.	1
my wife and i watch a film every night with no distractions, and mostly artsy films that require thought. i have tons of patience for films that are slow to blossom. my wife has double the attention span that i do. all that being said-- this film is just plain empty and boring! it went nowhere. never blossomed. it started fairly strong with a promising plot...then she bakes cookies...goes to spain....she sulks, she stares....the credits roll. uneven, full of holes, false starts & dead ends. we ff'd through several extended sequences of her just staring off into space. artificial depth was implied when she played with the mud and cried. zzzz...... it's like a beautifully shot chick-flick that's pretending to be deep or artsy. you never get to know nor understand morvern at all. about halfway through you just don't care anymore. we just wanted to see at least one of the plot lines develop. don't waste your time on this. i'm shocked it scores so high.	1
"nothing happens.<br /><br />then characters with no personality don't develop.<br /><br />then the end never comes because there's no beginning and no middle.<br /><br />there are beautiful shots that are made not beautiful because they aren't even allowed to be, because this movie isn't even there. there's no ""is"" in this movie because there's no plot or characters or themes or ideas or symbolism or discussion or dialog or point. there's nothing! <br /><br />there is a good point: it has a good soundtrack. but the sound editing is such and the movie proper is such that watching it isn't even worth your time, so if you're really interested, i'd suggest going and buying the soundtrack or something. you'll get everything you can from this movie without all the fatigue, headache, and impatience.<br /><br />--polarisdib"	1
there are a lot of pretentious people out there who will pretend that this is endowed with some kind of beautiful meaning, and that ignorant fools like me don't 'get' it. obviously this means that we should stick to hollywood dross.<br /><br />it has every, a-hem, artistic cliché in the book - i guess it is good that the director is one of the chosen few. almost a self parody drowning in its own pretense.<br /><br />the director of the (almost equally embarrassing) movie 'ratcatcher' returns with another piece wallowing in artistic nonsense; it is difficult to understand and apparently is a study of alienation. the best way to describe this film is alienating for its viewers.	1
it was probably just my dvd---but i would not recommend that anyone try to watch this picture on a dvd.<br /><br />i had to turn up the volume on my tv to the highest possible level, in order to hear about 80 percent of the dialog. some of the talking still remained sub-audible. if you're from scotland, you might have a chance, albeit a slim one.<br /><br />peoples voices were drowned out by nearly all ambient sounds, including unwrapping a package, footsteps, even puffing on a cigarette. <br /><br />with the volume turned up to a level at which voices can be heard, i can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will phone the police when the scene changes to a loud environment, such as a disco. and that you will injure yourself diving for the remote to turn it back down.<br /><br />there is art and there is art, even in the field of audio mixing. but this effort, in a time of war, would meet international criteria to be classified as an atrocity.<br /><br />after about a half hour, i gave up, having seen nothing else redeeming in the picture, either.	1
"when a movie of a book seems pointless and incomprehensible, the cause can invariably be found in the book: either it was pointless to start with, or the point is one not easily conveyed to film, or the movie missed the point, which is the most frequent of these results, and the easiest to happen, especially when the point is one not easily defined. the book ""morvern callar"" has a point; every reader of the book must have felt this, and felt as if he had gotten it; but i suspect most of them could not state it in words. i'm not sure i can, myself, but perhaps it comes to this, or something like it: things come, things go, such is life, but we carry on; or at any rate some of us--people like morvern--do. no doubt a more erudite critic could construct a more adequate definition. but the important fact is that there is a point--possibly the sum of the entire story is the point--and that this would have been the main thing to keep in view, and to carry over, in adapting the story to film. the maker of this film evidently missed the point, and doesn't substitute one of her own; and so the film is about nothing.<br /><br />this is not the usual complaint of a book-lover that his favorite text has been violated. the merit of the book is something i conceded grudgingly: in reading it i found it a bloody nuisance, and an occasion for kicking the author in the pants and getting him in to finish the job properly. the narrative is supposed to be the work of the half-educated morvern, but that illusion is constantly dispelled by a dozen different types of literary effect, as if the author were poking at her with his pen; there are inconsistencies of style and tone, as if different sections had been composed at different times; and any conclusions i could reach about morvern had to remain tentative because it was uncertain which implications the author intended and which he did not: for instance, despite morvern's own self-characterization as a raver, am i wrong that in the end she remains essentially a working-class scots girl, and beneath her wrapping of music downloads not so different from those of generations past? in any case, despite my irritation at the author, i couldn't deny that his book stuck with me; and what i couldn't get out of my head was his character's attitude, her angle on the world, which was almost as vivid as a goya portrait. morvern is the kind of person who's always encountering situations at once rather comic and rather horrible; occasionally she invites them but more often they land on her, like flies, so that much of her life consists of a kind of gauche but graceful slogging-through, unconsciously practical and unconsciously philosophical--and that doesn't begin to describe it idiosyncratically enough. the complex of incidents and of morvern's responses to them are the substance of the book, and its achievement, in exposing a cross-section of existence it would be difficult to illuminate otherwise; for all my dislike of the book, i can see this.<br /><br />the morvern just described is not the morvern of the movie; or if it is, most of her is kept offscreen. an actress who might have been a good fit for the character, had she been the right age at the right time, is angharad rees, from the old tv series ""poldark"". samantha morton, then, would seem like good casting: she's rather the same sort of actress, and in one of her earlier movies, ""jesus' son"", she played a girl who with a few adjustments could have been turned into this one. unfortunately, as the film turned out, she doesn't have the character from the book to play. for one thing, the book is one that, if it is to be dramatized, virtually cries out for monologues by the main character to the audience; without her comments, her perspective, her voice, the story loses most of its meaning. it has lost more of it in that the adaptor has expurgated it of its comic and horrible elements: the most memorable incidents from the book are curtailed before they turn grotty, and so morvern's responses (whether of amusement or distaste, depending on her mood) are missing too, and the incidents no longer have a reason for being in the story. in short, the filmmaker chose for some reason to turn a brisk, edgy serio-comic novel into a genteel art tv film, and chose as her typical image one of ms. morton languishing in a artistically shaded melancholy; as if the outing morvern signs up for were a tour of the stations of the cross. this isn't at all what the book, or the morvern of the book, was about. for another thing, the morvern of the movie isn't scottish (the actress said in an interview she hadn't had time to study up the accent), and she ought to be: it's important that she, her family, and her mates are all from a single place. and finally the film is missing the end of the story: morvern's spending all she has and coming home to icy darkness: it's winter, the dam has frozen, the power has gone out, and the pub is dark. minus this, and minus all of the rest, what's left is a failed art film, a dead film, about a subject whose strength lay precisely in her refusal, or native inability, ever to give in to being dead."	1
lynne ramsey makes arresting images, and samantha morton can summon feeling with a gesture. so what a drag to discover their talents wasted on this mannered, pretentious lark. <br /><br />ramsey can't bring callar to life. her attempts are too arty and oblique. repeatedly her camera lingers on long silent shots of the agonizing actress as if morton's obliterated gaze alone could supply character. we are in a blank warholian hell of self-indulgence: for a film that has minutes to spare on bugs crawling across the floor, you might think it could get round to fleshing out its protagonist. but how will it do so if she rarely speaks? without the novel's interior monologue, the celluloid morvern callar is nobody. small wonder ramsey has morton undress often.<br /><br />that said, the first ten minutes were so impressively acted, shot and edited that my hopes were soaring. give the film that much: it knows how to make promises, if not how to keep any.	1
"i have to admit that i stuck this one out thinking something would have to happen, besides the dead body in the first scenes... and her disposal of him. i was wrong. it was a cinema verite of betty hits the beach encased for the first part by mordant morven. i really don't care what young lassies from scotland do these days, who thy screw, what drugs they take. visually, the stroll through the cabo de gata in andalucia was pleasant and surely the high point for me. the nadir was the chop shop for her dead boyfriend. as the movie came to a close i had two thoughts... 1. that's all there is? 2. now i see why her boyfriend killed himself. rename it. ""bare bitch boredom, or what i did on my trip to spain."" i'm such a sucker for sticking these things out."	1
my dad is a fan of columbo and i had always disliked the show. i always state my disdain for the show and tell him how bad it is. but he goes on watching it none the less. that is his right as an american i guess. but my senses were tuned to the series when i found out that spielberg had directed the premier episode. it was then that i was thankful that my dad had bought this show that i really can't stand. i went through his dvd collection and popped this thing in when i came home for a visit from college. my opinion of the series as a whole was not swayed, but i did gain respect for spielberg knowing that he started out like most low tier directors. and that is making small dribble until the big fish comes along (get the pun, ha,ha. like spielberg did. it's like jesus before he became a man. or thats at least what i think that would feel like. any ways if your fan of columbo than you would most likely like this, even though it contains little of peter falk. i attribute this to the fact this is the start of the series and no one knew where to go with it yet. this episode mainly focuses on the culprit of the crime instead of columbo's investigation, as many later episodes would do.	1
my girlfriend once brought around the zombie chronicles for us to watch as a joke. little did we realize the joke was on her for paying £1 for it. while watching this film i started to come up with things i would rather be doing than watching the zombie chronicles. these included:<br /><br />1) drinking bleach 2) rubbing sand in my eyes 3) writing a letter to brad sykes and garrett clancy 4) re-enacting the american civil war 5) tax returns 6) gcse maths 7) sex with an old lady.<br /><br />garrett clancy, aka sgt. ben draper wrote this? the guy couldn't even dig a hole properly. the best ting he did was kick a door down (the best part of the film). this was the worst film i have ever seen, and i've seen white noise: the light. never has a film had so many mistakes in it. my girlfriend left it here, so now i live with the shame of owning this piece of crap.<br /><br />news just in: owen wilson watched this film and tried to kill himself. fact.<br /><br />do not watch	1
i'm a fan of arty movies, but regretfully i have to report this movie to be pretentious drivel. agonisingly slow to develop a non-existent plot based on a promising premise, the experience is, shall we say, trying. even after bad movies i feel that i learn something, or enjoyed some aspect, but there there was nothing to appreciate. the premise was not uninteresting, but the movie starts and ends there. the acting was ok, though the characters were utterly boring. for the protagonist to aim at such an audacious goal, she is mightily empty. pity. i usually enjoy movies that are unformulaic, but lack of formula should not be confused with zero content.	1
it a bit peculiar that a story that is placed in a part of oslo where a very high percentage of the local residents is from an asian background does not even show one asian or african person, not even as an extra. that fact probably describes norwegian race relations in general. - however.<br /><br />no spoilers - only a brief introductory description:<br /><br />buddy portrays four young people living in a flat-share in oslo. the protagonist are two young men that don't manage to direct their life in any serious fashion, and one might say that the film could be about being indecisive and avoiding responsibility - a sort of fear of growing up. the narrative plays on typical teenage dreams and fantasies and lifestyle role models. quite the cliché. although the story is mildly funny, the acting is good and as a 'young person' one can sort of identify with the characters `crazy' situations and complicated love affairs, i don't find the story or the characters very believable. to polished and lacking in depth. this film uses all the classic audience pleasing tricks to make an entertaining film that has as much intellectual depth as `friends' (yes that show on tv).<br /><br />has norwegian film finally found its identity?: audience pleasers in well known american style.<br /><br />how about watching lukas moodysson's tillsammans (together).	1
"since ""rugrats""' falling from the category of good and funny cartoon series to a mediocre and indeed outright horrible fare for two year olds in the past three or four years, obviously the tyrants at klasky-csupo should be out of ideas. after dumbing down all of the characters, adding even stupider new ones, replacing some voices (though i like nancy cartwright, she is not chucky finster!), and having no sense of continuity (ex.: in a kimi episode i watched the other day, tommy and chucky each got a new puppy; but it subsequent episode, the aforementioned dogs never appear), you'd think the creators could kill the show for mercy. but noooo.<br /><br />all i will say concerning this special is that it sucks! while not as horrible as the kimi episodes, everyone is even stupider than they were, including grandpa (my god! he used to be the best character on the show, but now, he has no real purpose). the ending is needlessly fluffy, and the only thing different between this and other crappy new episodes ('98-'01) is that the kids can interact with adults. whoa, what fun!<br /><br />no stars at all for ""the rugrats all growed up"". klasky-csupo, please destroy this show before it gets any worse."	1
"***comments contain spoilers*** i was barely holding on to this show as appointment tv when they started the annoying music under every scene, when don epps was averaging almost a shooting per case, when the very nasally diane farr was obviously pregnant (but we weren't to notice) and when colby was a f*****g triple agent. but now, in tonight's episode,david is trapped with a paranoid, nut job who is an obvious amateur with a gun, in an elevator and....he can't disarm him. a trained, experienced field agent who has been 1st through the door many times and is experienced in hand-to-hand fighting, can't take out a nut job. not when said nut job blinks, looks away, drops his head, closes his eyes; not even when he looks up at the fiber optic wire wriggling around the ceiling like a stripper on a pole for 20 seconds.<br /><br />then the scene came that let me know that as much as i enjoy learning from the chubby, frumpish but very charming charles epps and his sexy sidekick/love interest amita, my friday nights will be better spent otherwise engaged. don gives david the ""distress word"" that is the code for ""the s**t is about to go down""; david is ready, they kill the lights, drop the elevator, startle the nut job and......<br /><br />david cannot disarm/kill/beat into submission the nut job. the bad guy ends up with both guns, david ends up shot.<br /><br />i'm done. hope the numb3rs are fun."	1
here, let me wave my hands over the keyboard, i'll tell you what salad she's going to order. over and over, works like a charm: he's such a genius, omg how does he do it? my bullshit detector freaks if i even pass this show when i'm scanning channels, i have to be very careful (these days it's useful far too often, so i don't need it getting broken on idiotic crap like this...careful with that remote!). is this supposed to be some fascist propaganda to make people believe in some invisible realm of uberman control and mastery? or what? why does it exist??<br /><br />this is the most inane show, completely unbelievable and contrived, and i cannot understand why it's still on the air. so may geeks give so much better shows such a hard time (sarah connor chronicles, true blood), but give this nonsensical drivel a pass. shows like firefly (if there were any like that) fall away after a season, but mindless stuff like this that makes zero logical sense just keeps marching on. yeccch.	1
"after watching a dozen episodes, i decided to give up on this show since it depicts in an unrealistic manner what is mathematical modeling. in the episodes that charlie would predict the future behavior of individuals using mathematical models, i thought that my profession was being joked about. i am not a mathematician, instead a chemical engineer, but i do work a lot with mathematical models. so i will try to explain to the layman why what is shown is close to ""make-believe"" of fairy tales.<br /><br />first, choosing the right model to predict a situation is a demanding task. charlie eppes is shown as a genius, but even him would have to spend considerable time researching for a suitable model, specifically for trying to guess what someone will do or where he will be in the near future. individuals are erratic and haphazard, there is no modeling for them. isaac asimov even wrote about that in the 1950's. even if there were a model for specific kind of individual, it would be a probabilistic (stoichastic) one, meaning it has good chance of making a wrong prediction.<br /><br />second, supposing the right model for someone or a situation is found, the model parameters have to be known. these parameters are the constants of the equations, such as the gravity acceleration (9.8 m/s2), and often are not easy to determine. again, charlie eppes would have to be someone beyond genius to know the right parameters for the model he chooses. and after the model and the parameters are chosen, they would have to be tested. oddly, they are not, and by miracle, they fit exactly the situation that is being predicted.<br /><br />third, a very important aspect of modeling is almost always neglected, not only by numbers, but also by sci-fi movies: the computational effort required for solving these models. try to make excel solve a complex model with many equations and variables and one will find doing a herculean job. even if charlie eppes has the right software to solve his models, he might be stuck with hardware that will be dreadfully slow. and even with the right software/hardware combination, the model solution might well take days to be reached. he solves them immediately! i could use his computer in my research work, i would be very glad.<br /><br />as a drama, it is far from being the best show. the characters are somewhat stereotyped, but not even remotely funny as those in big bang theory are. the crimes are dull and the way charlie eppes solves them sometimes make the fbi look pretty incompetent.<br /><br />for some layman, the show might work. for others, the way things are handled makes it difficult to swallow!"	1
"the ""math"" aspect to this is merely a gimmick to try to set this tv show apart from the millions of other cop shows. the only redeeming aspect to this show is rob morrow, although his career must have been (undeservedly) waning after northern exposure if he signed up for this schlock.<br /><br />the lame-ness of the ""math"" aspect to the show is encapsulated in one episode co-starring lou diamond phillips (which just confirms that this show is the last refuge of the damned.) in order to catch a fugitive, the ""mathematician"" uses some theory about ""bubbles"". so, he gives this long explanation that, if we have seen the suspect in places a, b and c, then we can use ""bubble theory"" to calculate where he might be. he does this all on a chalkboard, or maybe with a stick in the dirt (i cant remember).<br /><br />anyway, when you look at the finished product, he basically took three spots, and picked a point right in the middle and said ""ok, mathematically, here's where we are most likely to find the fugitive."" at which point, one other character points out ""oh, that point also happens to be the cabin where the guy used to live."" is that math? its not even connect-the-f**k**g-dots!!! this show reminds me of the math major i used to work with in banking who had a mathematical analysis he could do to ""support"" points that every one else had already agreed on through either less-complex analysis or basic common sense.<br /><br />it just goes to show -- when you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail. i can't wait til they stick the numb3rs team on osama... they'll use calculus, call an airstrike in the middle of the mountains, and hit osama and not even scratch the five children he uses as human shields... cuz hey... its all about the numbers.<br /><br />totally ludicrous tv show."	1
"this is really really bad. lamas shows just how a second rate actor does his job. but what makes it worth watching is the scene where oj angrily grabs a fellow cop by the throat as if to kill them while the jukebox plays a song with the lyric ""i got the evidence on you!"". (makes me want to hear the rest of the lyrics - attributed to david gregoli and leslie oren but i couldn't find it on itunes). talk about seeing into the future...too funny for words. the rest of the movie is forgettable. the score and songs are more interesting than the script. ditto the sequel. which begs the question of why they would do a sequel at all. my understanding was that foreign sales drives a lot of these b movies. doesn't say much for the world's viewing habits."	1
"cia codename:alexa"" is an absolute horrible rip off of luc besson's classic film ""la femme nikita""(1990). the film is basically about a woman who is taken in and trained by the cia and is forced to do a secret mission for them. (pretty much the same story structure of la femme nikita) the acting combo of lorenzo lamas and o.j. simpson is perhaps the worst in cinema history. lamas' ""acting"" is simply a bad steven segal impersonation. watching orenthal act in this film is an excruciating experience.<br /><br />the writing and acting is so poor in this film at times it is laughable. there are so many action movie ""conventions"" in the film it is ridiculous: unnecessary car explosions, people flying thru glass windows, terrorists, bad ponytails, etc. the musical score resembles david michael frank's score for ""hard to kill"" (1990), which furthers the steven segal theme of this movie. there is plenty of martial arts in the film, and it is pretty well done for a low budget american production. the mindless action and over the top acting never lets up, and i have to admit i was mildly entertained. <br /><br />lorenzo lamas had the look of an action star back in the early 90's but he is certainly no action star, that is why he is doing soap operas and not action blockbusters. my recommendation is that you skip ""cia codename:alexa"" and check out ""la femme nikita"" instead.	1
i don't understand how ""2 of us"" receive such a high rating... i thought that the first half dragged on and the second half didnt make sense, followed by an unresolved climax which was not worth the trouble. however, i did like jared harris' performance of john lennon which was worth the wasted 2 hours.	1
lorenzo lamas stars as some type of cia agent, who captures some exotic beauty named alexa, kidnaps her daughter and forces her to fight her former employers. o.j simpson is also on board to provide a dash of acting credibility for the not so talented ensemble. i must admit i'm not a fan of lorenzo lamas, or his movies. he stinks. however when compared to o.j simpson and lamas' comatose wife kinmont, lamas seems like ah, jean-claude van damme. i only saw cia because of the renewed interest around the o.j simpson trial, you see because if your parents had cable and the extra channels, you couldn't escape this movie. in 1994 you could go to an amish community and some moron would have this playing in their portable tv. the movie itself is a collection of lame action sequences and would be intrigue although the shock value of o.j simpson jumping after fireballs and exchanging would be one liners do provide some unintentional humor. also where was bobby knight and kobe bryant to make this a complete camp classic? <br /><br />* out of 4-(bad)	1
spoiler alert in this generic and forgettable action movie, lorenzo lamas does his usual tough guy/pretty boy act, and his future real life ex kathleen kinmont is ass kicking hot chick alexa. oj simpson is a detective, coasting by on his since vanished genial public persona. translation: cable tv filler. there isn't enough skin to qualify this as a guilty pleasure.<br /><br />the script has some gaping holes. best/worst moment: in one jarring scene, oj's partner expresses his aversion to the morgue. oj responds that some of the bodies are pretty hot, or words to that effect. this vague necrophilia reference is offensive enough; but in light of the murders committed shortly after this movie was released, it is truly appalling, and therefore entertaining in an unintentional, horrible way. i was so startled that i laughed until champagne came out of my nose. now that's a guilty pleasure. bc	1
as an impressionable 10 year old, i liked the ""love conquers all"" philosophy of the 70s sitcom ""bridget loves bernie."" i did understand the controversy, which was about the romantic complications between a jewish cab driver (david birney) and an irish catholic school teacher (meredith baxter) and both sets of parents (harold j. stone and bibi osterwald as bernie's parents; audra lindley and david doyle as bridget's parents) who have issues with the young couple's interfaith marriage.<br /><br />looking at the show now with years of personal life experiences, i am amazed that the show was even a success for one, albeit, highly-rated season. created by veteran tv writer bernard slade, who a few years after the show's cancellation would write the successful play ""same time, next year"", ""bridget loves bernie"" was a very light, superficial comedy that collapsed under its own airy weight.<br /><br />there was no denying the real-life chemistry between birney and baxter. but, in later years, both actors have shown that they are better actors in other projects (birney in his short-lived role in ""st. elsewhere"" and baxter in ""family"" and ""family ties""). here, they were trying to breathe life in a show that needed a much gritter comic edge, which might have given the complications more depth to a very controversial subject.<br /><br />the show aired saturday nights between two cbs powerhouses: ""all in the family"" and ""mary tyler moore"". both of those shows were smart, funny and had enough of an edge (more so on the former that the latter) that kept my interest in the situation and the characters. ""bridget loves bernie"" was not very smart and only had some occasional chuckles.<br /><br />this was another example of a show that really was not as good as i remembered.	1
this film was hard to get a hold of, and when i eventually saw it the disappointment was overwhelming. i mean, this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century: an unknown man takes advantage of the unsuspecting airline industry and gets away with millions in ransom without hurting anyone or bungling the attempt. with all of this built-in interest, how could anyone make such a lackluster, talk-laden flick of this true-life event. while williams is always interesting, the screenwriters assumed that the d.b. cooper persona was stereotypically heroic like a movie star, s what we get is a type-without any engaging details or insights into the mind of a person daring enough and clever enough to have pulled it off. harrold practically steals the movie with her spunk and pure beauty, but the real letdown was in the handling of the plot and the lame direction. shame on this film for even existing.	1
as someone who likes chase scenes and was really intrigued by this fascinating true-life tale, i was optimistic heading into this film but too many obstacles got into the way of the good story it should have been.<br /><br />the bad - i'm a fan of robert duvall and many of the characters he has played, but his role here is a dull one as an insurance investigator.<br /><br />the dialog is insipid and the pretty kathryn harrold is real garbage-mouth. from what i read, there were several directors replacing each other on this film, and that's too bad. you can tell things aren't right with the story. i couldn't get ""involved"" with treat williams' portrayal of cooper, either. he should have been fascinating, but he wasn't in this movie. it's also kind of a sad comment that a guy committing a crime is some sort of ""folk hero,"" but i admit i wound up rooting for the guy, too.<br /><br />not everything was disappointing. i can't complain about the scenery, from the lush, green forests of oregon to the desert in arizona.<br /><br />i'd like to see this movie re-made and done better, because it is a one-of-a-kind story.	1
i can't believe that people thought this stinking heap of trash was funny. shifting the attempts at humor among cruelty, disgust and stupidity, 'there's something about mary' leaves little reason to stay until the end. sure, cameron diaz is very pretty, but that is never going to be enough to save a movie. ben stiller tries hard to work within the plot, and is obviously very talented, but the movie is a loser.<br /><br />not once were any of the scenes believable. the shots were badly timed and poorly framed. the farreley brothers should be kept away from making films at all costs. i check imdb to see what they are working on just so i know what to avoid.<br /><br />2/10; the bonus is from the one time i smiled. it's not like i'm immune to humor or alone in my opinion. my wife hated it, too. the next day we saw 'rush hour' and laughed ourselves silly. this movie just stunk.	1
to be honest at the time i first heard of this show i though it may be a bad idea to make a show that makes muslims use racial jokes on themselves but it is the exact opposite. i realized that the show doing that can help people understand that if a muslim uses s a word like this in real life it doesn't mean it is a terrorist thing. it also show's how people give the muslims a bad name because they play on their stereotype, by watching the show regular people will realize that all though there may be bad muslims out it doesn't mean we are all bad we just try to live 1 day at a time, like how hard it was for amair to get on a plane and how he used words like ""blow up"" or yaser saying we'll blow away the competition, and people took it the wrong way. being a muslim i know that stuff like this don't usually happen, but they do and many people think bad things about muslims or afghanistan or iraq, its not right things are not like that. people will see how we are poorly treated by watching this show and it may make them think on how the act. i am glad a show like this came on the air. there are many shows that piotr muslim people as terrorists,many people do find them funny to my opioion it is ok to do it now and then because prety much everything is made fun of who are we to say you can not make fun of that is unfair, but it is done to often and really gives muslin people a bad name.	1
up until this new season i have been a big 'little mosque' fan. however, the new season had absolutely ruined it.<br /><br />the new christian vicar has destroyed the entire intent of the show. it has always been about living together to overcome prejudice. the new vicar ruins that premise and shows christians in a very bad light.<br /><br />i am neither christian or muslim, but loved watching the show and seeing the camaraderie between amar and the reverend. not any more.<br /><br />just cancel it and be done with it. it's not worth watching any more.<br /><br />it might still be saved, but a lot of change would need to be made.<br /><br />bring back the old format.	1
who likes awful ""comedy"" shows like little mosque on the prairie? the only two kinds of people i can think of who watch this are: one, muslims and self-proclaimed liberal defenders of every ethnic group who are so thrilled there is a show about muslims that it doesn't even matter if the show is good or funny at all (which it is not). two, old people and people whose idea of comedy is incredibly predictable, badly written, stale jokes.<br /><br />cbc needs to really take a look at what they are doing and who their audience is. if they keep only writing comedy for really old people then guess what will happen, their audience will die off soon and they will have no audience left. i'd be curious who even writes for this show? do you think it's actually muslims, or hip, funny young people? no, i bet it is old white guys who have been writing the same jokes for the same kind of bad cbc shows since the 1960's.<br /><br />when you look at the cbc comedy shows there are, air farce was only finally just taken off the air (thank goodness!) but we still have lame ducks like this hour has 22 minutes and rick mercer that we are paying for, not to mention this poor excuse for ""comedy"" little mosque on the prairie. it is supposed to be offencive and funny? only the cbc would think this lame show is at all offencive or funny. shame on the cbc for squandering our tax dollars on shows only a few people would bother watching.	1
unlike many, i don't find the premise or theme of this show the least bit offensive. its execution, however, is another matter entirely. like so many b-minus movies, all the decent gags appear to have been spliced into the trailers. for most of the 22-or-so minutes we sit in waning anticipation any morsel of real humor. or at least something to keep one from fidgeting with the remote or counting carpet fibers. with a couple of exceptions the acting is awful; the comical over-emoting and gesticulating of some cast members might be well suited to a late-night infomercial, but not a primetime sitcom (even a canadian one.) notwithstanding the admittedly original cultural angle, i cannot help but think this is mainly a misfired shot by the cbc to replicate the success of corner gas. unfortunately, they got the tone -- and the script -- completely wrong for the prairies. the final insult is that they apparently couldn't even afford to have the location work done in an actual small town (why? are they so hard to find in saskatchewan?) did they think the audience would be fooled by the downtown regina exteriors? as a proud canadian i hope this thing goes away soon, and that the rest of the world, primed by the cbc's publicists, quickly forgets this colossal embarrassment of a sitcom.	1
this movie is one long chiche after another. first of all, though they did their share, there is a unwarranted dope scene where john sniffs weed like an idiot. the wigs and accents are terrible. they sound worse then the old beatle cartoons. john is the nasty, envious, closet homosexual, slave to yoko he is portrayed as being in the discredited albert goldman book. they even keep spouting song titles in regular conversation ""it was always just the two of us""! john would not have been mean to his fans like this either. like his death showed us he was too nice if anything. the one funny scene is where a dumb beatle fan only recognizes john and asks him to sing paul's yesterday. an insulted john says something along the lines of ""sure and while i croon why don't you get down on your knees, put on your wife's wig, and lick my liggin"". that made me laugh for days. really this movie is funny in how serious it tries to be while coming off ridiculous. john and paul also did not sit pontificating all day, they were funny light hearted guys who even during the beatles break up where far more personable then portrayed here. forget it.	1
i was really hoping that this would be a funny show, given all the hype and the clever preview clips. and talk about hype, i even heard an interview with the show's creator on the bbc world today - a show that is broadcast all over the world.<br /><br />unfortunately, this show doesn't even come close to delivering. all of the jokes are obvious - the kind that sound kind of funny the first time you hear them but after that seem lame - and they are not given any new treatment or twist. all of the characters are one-dimensional. the acting is - well - mediocre (i'm being nice). it's the classic cbc recipe - one that always fails.<br /><br />if you're muslim i think you would have to be stupid to believe any of the white characters, and if you're white you'd probably be offended a little by the fact that almost all of the white characters are portrayed as either bigoted, ignorant, or both. not that making fun of white people is a problem - most of the better comedies are rooted in that. it's only a problem when it isn't funny - as in this show.<br /><br />canada is bursting with funny people - so many that we export them to hollywood on a regular basis. so how come the producers of this show couldn't find any?	1
this show is terrible, the jokes are all terrible and just getting worse and worse. i am one of those people who was never a big fan of corner gas but at least i liked it at first until it got into a rut around season two, all the jokes had been played out and the characters had nothing to them. well at least corner gas was good at first, little mosque on the prairie is typically awful bland cbc comedy that had nothing going for it from episode 1. who are the people who are watching this show anyway, i am being honest is it old people or maybe just people who actually live on the prairies? maybe the jokes are for them and they work there? i don't know a single person who likes this show and can't stand it myself, the jokes are totally predictable and the characters are even less developed than in corner gas. hopefully it won't last much longer because all the success this show has had seems to me to be based entirely on the premise of this show being muslim which is different and could/should have led to a great show.	1
if you're looking to be either offended or amused or both, you'll probably have to look elsewhere. lmotp really isn't even very thought provoking beyond rehashing the usual silly clichés. at the end of the second episode i felt a little embarrassed that i actually sat through the contrived mess.<br /><br />beyond the thinly veiled gimmicky premise thats attracted all the initial attention to it in the first place it's just another lame, innocuous and anti-septic attempt at commentary and entertainment that the cbc typically excels at producing. and once the ""zomg muslims in rural canada roflmao!!"" hype wears out its welcome, the show is likely to follow into the ether of cancellation because it's so shallow when judged on its merits alone.<br /><br />unless you're obsessed with muslim culture in the west and/or are easily amused by the most minute idiosyncrasies on the subject i really don't see how lmotp is enjoyable beyond satisfying the curiosity that stemmed from the hype. other shows have better addressed the issue of cultural/ethnic dichotomy in western multi-ethnic societies. lmotp will never rank among them in entertainment or insight.	1
little mosque is one of the most boring cbc comedies i have ever seen. they have a way of producing the easiest comedy programming they can for the oldest most-easily-offended viewers which for cbc means 85 year old farmers in saskatchewan. the jokes are all predictable and so deathly lame i can't believe it. the performances are very hammy and over acted but i don't blame the actors since those kind of one dimensional stereotyped characters are probably exactly what the cbc asked for and demanded. very lame show with bad jokes they tried to present as ""controversial"" well it is less controversial than the other boring cbc comedies like the hour has 22 minutes, royal canadian air farce and rick mercer's report.	1
this series just gets worse and worse. poorly written and just plain not funny! the premise is excellent, but the writer's inexperience shines through. by trying so hard to offend no one they end up insulting everyone. now into the second season the desperate cast have stopped waving their arms about, and resorted to that patronizing, smug, ""oh, silly you"" style acting that comes with a no laugh script. they roll their eyes and shake their heads at each other as if to say, aren't we zany? isn't this funny? well, no, it's not actually. gum disease is less painful. no wonder, with the exception of corner gas, canadians generally avoid canadian tv. come on cbc you're suppose to be our leading station showcasing the best of canadian talent. pull the plug on this amateurish mess.	1
once again canadian tv outdoes itself and creates another show that will go unwatched after its premiere episode. <br /><br />last time i remember sitcoms were supposed to induce a reaction we in the business call laughter. how funny is it to beat the stereotype of all white people thinking that all muslims are terrorists? ok maybe one joke just to stick it to the masses. but not 30 minutes. it's called beating a dead horse. even snl would know to give up after a commercial break.<br /><br />also, let's have a little conflict in these scripts. will she or won't she be able to serve cucumber sandwiches to break the fast on ramadan? when will ramadan start? ohhhhh this is emmy winning stuff here. <br /><br />and the characters! what characters?! they are all cardboard cut-outs without anything interesting to make us want to follow them from one situation to the next. that's the point of the situation comedy. we need to have strong, interesting, dynamic characters so that we are constantly drawn to the tv set each week. we have to care about these characters to worry about what trouble they're going to get into next week. if i never see these characters it'll be too soon. thankfully i can't remember any of their names (note to cbc - that's not a good sign).<br /><br />and the acting is so bland. it's more so a problem in casting than in the actors. none of these people actually embody the characters they play. they just seem to act their part as though they were working on a movie of the week. sitcoms require actors who live and breathe that character - make us fall in love with them - where they become inseparable from the character the portray. watch any american sitcom and you'll see how easily identifiable characters are. part of the problem is that the actors seem to treat this project as though it might be a platform to bigger and better things instead of being their one big character of a lifetime for whom they will spend the next 8 years portraying. that level of disinterest in the characters and the project shows. but to be honest, considering the lame concept and the horrible writing, there's not much for the actors to do but say their lines and try not to bump into any furniture. as another commenter mentions, this seems like a tv movie and not a sitcom.<br /><br />and the directing or lack there of! what can i say, canada has so much talent, look at what the comedy channel is doing with puppets who kill and punched up. look at the trailer park boys (not the movie cause it bit the big helium dog). look at any american show to see the potentials our talent as that's where many of our stars go to find decent work.<br /><br />give credit to the cbc, they really know how to build publicity for a non-event. remember ""the one""? no - well don't even try to learn any characters names in this show, as it's sure to go the way of the dodo.<br /><br />let's all hope for a full blown actra strike so that nothing like this emerges from the ceeb for a good long while.	1
this show is a perfect example of how the cbc should stick to either news, sports, or satirical sketch comedy. as a developer of situation comedy, cbc has shown it can combine the pizazz of ""king of kensington"" with the belly laughs of ""the beachcombers"". it is an embarrassment to great shows like ""kids in the hall"" and ""second city"" that they have to share their comedic roots with this lame production.<br /><br />i have to admit, that i didn't give this show much of a chance right from when i first heard of its concept. to start, half of the concept is a direct attempt to rip-off one of the few sitcom successes in english-canadian history, ""corner gas"". the rest of the concept--the cultural clash--is far from being original and is too often used as a crutch for screen writing laziness. the selection of the muslim religion as the basis for the ""fish out of water"" characters seems to be a desperate attempt to be ""edgy"" and ""topical"", but comes off as forced. some of the jokes that are based around the local's reaction to the newcomers are cringe inducing and thoroughly insulting to the intelligence of everyone involved, especially the audience.<br /><br />this show is a perfect example of how cbc just doesn't ""get it"" when it comes to creating canadian content, especially when presenting canada as a multicultural environment. cultural diversity in canada does not have to be presented in such a heavy-handed and forced way. it would be a refreshing change to see cbc introduce diversity into a television show without making the show all about said diversity. i doubt that cbc has sufficient sitcom talent to pull off something so subtle. a comparison could be made to the way diversity is depicted in corner gas--i.e. the aboriginal characters are not set apart by their ethnicity nor is their heritage used to generate story lines. more realistically, their lives and the other characters lives intertwine in a way that makes ethnicity no more significant than any of their other personal characteristics.<br /><br />that being said, even as a formulaic fish-out-of-water comedy this show fails. the acting is weak, the comic pacing all over the map, and the story premises that i saw were too far beyond the suspension of belief, even for a comedy. the only saving grace is the talented derek mcgrath, who is horribly wasted here. i doubt that even the addition of guest stars (colin mochrie, for example, as an anglican archbishop) can save this dog. i decided to give the show a chance once the cbc's 'hype' had died down; but two episodes were all i could stand--i could almost feel my braincells shutting themselves down with each failed punchline. the time-slot would be better served by airing more coronation street, air farce re-runs, or dr. who. even an infomercial would be an improvement.	1
i think the show had a pretty good concept to work with. but the execution was poor. the script is poor and acting is bad. there were many issues that could have been portrayed in a better way, like the protest against gay marriage or finding the graveyard. the show can't be properly termed as comedy show as it lacks humor miserably. i should say this show was barely successful in putting the life of muslim community to some extent.<br /><br />till now second season is worse than the first one. i had my hopes high regarding this show, but i was kind of disappointed. still i appreciate cbc for putting up such concept in front of the viewers. anyway i wish best of luck for the future.	1
i'm trying to picture the pitch for dark angel. ""i'm thinking matrix, i'm thinking bladerunner, i'm thinking that chick that plays faith in angel, wearing shiny black leather - or some chick just like her, leave that one with us. only - get this! - we'll do it without any plot, dialogue, character, decent action or budget, just some loud bangs and a hot chick in shiny black leather straddling a big throbbing bike. fanboys dig loud bangs and hot chicks in shiny black leather straddling big throbbing bikes, right?""<br /><br />flashy, shallow, dreary, formulaic, passionless, tedious, dull, dumb, humourless, desultory, barely competent. live action anime without any action, or indeed any life. sf just the way joe fanboy likes it, in fact. :(	1
while i have never been a fan of the original scooby-doo (due to its horrid production values), it appears like shakespeare compared to this pile of crap brought to us by hanna-barbera! without a doubt, scrappy-doo is about the most annoying and awful character created for children (and this includes the teletubbies as well as tommy the tapeworm). whose bright idea was it to create some sort of short mutant dog and enable it to speak and then saddle the scooby-doo characters with it?! whoever it is deserves to die or watch this show (i think death is preferable). the bottom line is that the little dog is simply unfunny, annoying and grates on the nerves--and this is only in the better episodes!! after many years, it would have been better to just end the franchise than create this mess! i can see why in the live-action scooby-doo movie they made the villain scrappy-doo--since practically everyone hates him!	1
wow, here it finally is; the action ""movie"" without action. in a real low-budget setting (don't miss the hilarious flying saucers flying by a few times) of a future seattle we find a no-brain hardbody seeking to avenge her childhood.<br /><br />there is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors' performance is only rivalled in stupidity by the attempts to steal from other movies, mainly ""matrix"" without having the money to do it right. yes, we do get to see some running on walls and slow motion shoot-outs (45 secs approx.) but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid hardbody's attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and then.<br /><br />and, yes, we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere, as if the script was thought-out by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenes.<br /><br />believe me, it is as bad as it possibly can get. in fact, it doesn't deserve to be taken seriously, but perhaps i can make some of you not rent it and save your money.	1
god, i was bored out of my head as i watched this pilot. i had been expecting a lot from it, as i'm a huge fan of james cameron (and not just since ""titanic"", i might add), and his name in the credits i thought would be a guarantee of quality (then again, he also wrote the leaden strange days..). but the thing failed miserably at grabbing my attention at any point of its almost two hours of duration. in all that time, it barely went beyond its two line synopsis, and i would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of strands that went nowhere. on top of that, i don't think the acrobatics outdid even those of any regular ""a-team"" episode. as for alba, yes, she is gorgeous, of course, but the fact that she only displays one single facial expression the entire movie (pouty and surly), makes me also get bored of her ""gal wit an attitude"" schtick pretty soon. you can count me out of this one, mr. cameron!	1
awful, simply awful. it proves my theory about ""star power."" this is supposed to be great tv because the guy who directed (battlestar) titanica is the same guy who directed this shlop schtock schtick about a chick. b o r i n g.<br /><br />find something a thousand times more interesting to do - like watch your tv with no picture and no sound. 1/10 (i rated it so high b/c there aren't any negative scores in the imdb.com rating system.)<br /><br />-zaphoid<br /><br />ps: my theory about ""star power"" is: the more ""star power"" used in a show, the weaker the show is. (it's called an indirect proportionality: quality 1/""star power"", less ""sp"" makes for better quality, etc. another way to look at it is: ""more is less."")<br /><br />-z	1
what was an exciting and fairly original series by fox has degraded down to meandering tripe. during the first season, dark angel was on my weekly ""must see"" list, and not just because of jessica alba.<br /><br />unfortunately, the powers-that-be over at fox decided that they needed to ""fine-tune"" the plotline. within 3 episodes of the season opener, they had totally lost me as a viewer (not even to see jessica alba!). i found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish. the new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin. on one of the second season episodes, they even had max sleeping and dreaming - where the first season stated she biologically couldn't sleep.<br /><br />the moral of the story (the one that hollywood never gets): if it works, don't screw with it!<br /><br />azjazz	1
a story of amazing disinterest kills ""the psychic"" over and over again. the characters and plot are completely uninteresting (as is fulci's mad camera work, which is usually a redeeming factor in his films), and any grasp of suspense is nowhere to be found. it's padded out to an insufferable degree--by the end, you won't be clamoring with excitement but stricken with boredom (and, like me, maybe an uncontrollable urge to fall asleep). jennifer o'neill's performance deserves occupancy in a better movie. fulci gorehounds beware--there's just not much going on in ""the psychic.""<br /><br />3/10	1
average (and surprisingly tame) fulci giallo which means it's still quite bad by normal standards, but redeemed by its solid build-up and some nice touches such as a neat time twist on the issues of visions and clairvoyance.<br /><br />the genre's well-known weaknesses are in full gear: banal dialogue, wooden acting, illogical plot points. and the finale goes on much too long, while the denouement proves to be a rather lame or shall i say: limp affair.<br /><br />fulci's ironic handling of giallo norms is amusing, though. yellow clues wherever you look.<br /><br />3 out of 10 limping killers	1
i was really disappointed in this movie. those that voted this thing a 10 have a screw lose. the acting was ok, kinda wooden and cardboard. the ending was sorry. i just didn't care for this at all.<br /><br />no way could i recommend this mess.	1
man the ending of this film is so terribly unwatchable and dated that my entire film aesthetics class laughed like crazy. now most of the rest of the film was okay. it had a few unintentionally funny scenes but had a few real good camera shots and editing. yes alderich is a great director who made flight of the phoenix and whatever happened to baby jane among others. the problem isn't with direction, acting or anything technical. the movie is just destroyed in the third act. why? the murders, twists, turns and characters have all been revolving around nuclear material? what the heck was the writer smoking when he came up with that? the way it just comes out of nowhere may have been the biggest deus ex machina in history. for all the complaints about burton's planet of the apes, the life of david gale or notorious i think this is the worst ending ever. what a let down.	1
this movie is just plain dumb.<br /><br />from the casting of ralph meeker as mike hammer to the fatuous climax, the film is an exercise in wooden predictability.<br /><br />mike hammer is one of detective fiction's true sociopaths. unlike marlow and spade, who put pieces together to solve the mystery, hammer breaks things apart to get to the truth. this film turns hammer into a boob by surrounding him with bad guys who are ... well, too dumb to get away with anything. one is so poorly drawn that he succumbs to a popcorn attack.<br /><br />other parts of the movie are right out of the three stooges play book. velda's dance at the barre, for instance, or the bad guy who accidentally stabs his boss in the back. and the continuity breaks are shameful: frau blucher is running down the centerline of the road when the camera is tight on her lower legs but she's way over the side when the camera pulls back for a wider shot. the worst break, however, precedes the popcorn attack. the bad guy stalking hammer passes a clock seconds after our hero, except the clock shows he was seven minutes behind our guy.<br /><br />to be fair, there were some interesting camera angles and lighting, and the grand finale is so bad that it must been seen, which is the only reason that it gets two points out of 10.	1
how did mike hammer live - in a penthouse with a golf bag stashed in the corner next to a big screen cathode ray tube tv and a snazzy fireplace? nah, he'd knock back a bottle of rye and twenty unfiltered camels on the couch or floor of his fly-specked office or in the stink of a lousy downtown la flop house, wiping the dried red crust and oil smeared mud off his face, that's how. spillane wrote trash paperbacks, for sure, but how do you make it worse? give some desperate scheming producer a blank check because he thinks any film noir titled crap will sell at the box office, add some over-the-hill hot tomatoes and just generally screw-up the story-line by some retard, drugged out screen writer, that's how!	1
i grew up on scooby doo where are you, and i still love it. it is one of my favourite cartoons along with darkwing duck, talespin, peter pan and the pirates and tom and jerry. this show though is good for kids, the voices are good(don messick and casey kasem are perfect as scooby and shaggy), the theme tune is tolerable and it has some nice animation. however it is rather disappointing. i normally don't mind scrappy, but when he appears to be like the main character, it gets annoying fast. complete with the catchphrase puppy power, scrappy is somewhat more annoying than usual. also half the gang are missing after the first year, somehow it didn't feel like scooby doo. and the jokes and the story lines were in general lame and unoriginal, very little chasing monsters or unmasking the baddies. all in all, not as bad as shaggy and scooby doo:get a clue, but this show is disappointing. 4/10 for the animation, voices, theme tune and the fact it is nice for kids. bethany cox	1
this is one of the worst films i've ever seen. i looked into it mainly out of a morbid curiosity since i loved the novel, and i wish i hadn't. i turned it off after a little less than an hour, though i wanted to turn it off after five minutes. i wish i had. it disregards the novel a lot and changes all sorts of factors. unless the film managed to redeem itself in the last 50 or so minutes (which would be impossible) i would in no way recommend this. its an insult to one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. i don't think, as many people say that it is, that ""the bell jar"" is necessarily unfilmable, but this particular rendition could have been done without. i'd almost like to see this one day in the hands of a director and screenwriter who can do it justice.	1
jameson parker and marilyn hassett are the screen's most unbelievable couple since john travolta and lily tomlin. larry peerce's direction wavers uncontrollably between black farce and roman tragedy. robert klein certainly think it's the former and his self-centered performance in a minor role underscores the total lack of balance and chemistry between the players in the film. normally, i don't like to let myself get so ascerbic, but the bell jar is one of my all-time favorite books, and to watch what they did with it makes me literally crazy.	1
the golden era of disney cartoons was dying by the time the end of the 90s. this show quack pack shouldn't even be considered a ducktales spin off because the show barely had anything to do with ducktales. it's about a teen-aged huey, dewey and louie as they make trouble for their uncle donald and talk in hip-hop lingo and they are fully dressed unlike in ducktales. i prefer the little adventurous nephews from ducktales. there are humans in duckburg and the ducks are the only animals living in duckburg. there's no references of scrooge mcduck. the stories are repetitive, the plot is boring but the animation is good. if you want lots of slapstick humor, i recommend this to you. if you want a better disney show watch ""darkwing duck"" or ""ducktales"".	1
saw this film ran in the wee hours on tcm. several problems with the film were apparent from what i saw. first, the adults did not age when the children did for 10 years. several parts of the film had continuity problems & for some reason the actor who played the youngest son looked like the oldest when the 10 years passed. <br /><br />the copy i saw was missing about 20 minutes or so, at least a huge gap with black screen appeared. it is too bad, because even though the script left something to be desired, bergman & russell both did fine in the film in their roles. it is a shame the large chunk is missing, but what is here is watchable.<br /><br />i just wish it was all intact. the script makes little sense in that bergman's character is sent away when the kids are small but then brought back to take care of them when they are adults? some of the time lines don't make sense either. there is a stock market crash that resembles 1929 but the kids grow up to fight in world war 1. all the acting by the support folks in this film is fine. just wonder what was in the 20 gap of film i could not see as it was missing.	1
by 1941 columbia was a full-fledged major studio and could produce a movie with the same technical polish as mgm, paramount or warners. that's the best thing that could be said about ""adam had four sons,"" a leaden soap opera with almost terminally bland performances by ingrid bergman (top-billed for the first time in an american film) and warner baxter. bergman plays a frenchwoman (this was the era in which hollywood thought one foreign accent was as good as another) hired as governess to baxter's four sons and staying on (with one interruption caused by the stock-market crash of 1907) until the boys are grown men serving in world war i. just about everyone in the movie is so goody-good it's a relief when susan hayward as the villainess enters midway through  she's about the only watchable person in the movie even though she's clearly channeling bette davis and vivien leigh; it's also the first in her long succession of alcoholic roles  but the script remains saccharine and the ending is utterly preposterous. no wonder bergman turned down the similarly plotted ""the valley of decision"" four years later.	1
you'd think that with ingrid bergman and warner baxter that this film would have been a lot better. sadly, the film suffers from difficult to believe characters as well as a major plot problem that makes some of the characters seem brain-addled.<br /><br />the film begins with ingrid bergman coming to work for the stoddard family. everything is so very peachy and swell--the family adores bergman and things couldn't be more perfect. well, that is until the mother (fay wray) dies, the stock market crashes in 1907 (wiping out the family's fortune) and bergman is forced to go back home to france. this portion of the film is a bit sticky sweet, but not bad.<br /><br />later, after the family's fortunes have improved, bergman returns. the four boys are now all grown and there isn't really a conceivable reason why they'd hire her once again as a governess. but, briefly, everything is swell once again. but, when wwi occurs, the four all go to war--gosh! in the midst of this, one of the sons (david) brings home his new wife (susan hayward). miss hayward's character is as black and white as the others, though while they are all good and swell, she's obviously a horny she-devil. to make things worse, she comes to live in the family home while david is at war.<br /><br />now here is where the movie gets really, really dumb--brain-achingly dumb. hayward begins an affair with one of david's brothers but when the father sees a silhouette of the lovers, bergman enters the room from another entrance and pretends that it was her, not hayward with jack! why?! why would any sane person do this to save the butt of an obviously evil and conniving woman? this was exactly the sort of excuse bergman needed to get rid of the gutter-snipe once and for all! this is just a case of lousy writing and made me mad...and most likely did the same to the audiences back in 1941.<br /><br />the rest of the movie consists of failed opportunity after failed opportunity for hayward's evilness to be exposed. this just flies against common sense and made the film a silly melodramatic mess. as expected, however, the truth eventually comes out and everyone is swell once again---happy to be one big loving wonderful family minus the slut, hayward.<br /><br />the film suffers because of poor writing. hayward's affair made no sense--at least in how it was handled. and, having characters who are so gosh-darn good or evil (with nothing in between) sinks this movie to the level of a second-rate soap. the only thing that saves it at all is the acting---they tried as best they could with a turgid script. suffice to say that the columbia pictures writers who did this film should have been slapped with a dead chicken!	1
i just saw adam had four sons for the first time and the thing that struck me was that i believe that the model used was theodore roosevelt and his four sons. they were approximately the same ages as the four boys in this film. warner baxter in his portrayal of adam stoddard talked about the same values and family tradition that you would have heard from our 26th president without some of the more boisterous aspects of tr's character. <br /><br />like tr all of the stoddard sons serve in world war i, in this case though the youngest only loses an eye instead of being killed. <br /><br />but what if a female minx gets into this all male household and disrupts things? that's susan hayward's job here. in one of her earliest prominent roles, hayward is a flirtatious amoral girl who marries one son, has an affair with another, and starts making a play for the third. it's an early forerunner of the kind of a part that later brought her an oscar in i want to live.<br /><br />i suppose that with as powerful a model of decorum as theodore roosevelt was and warner baxter portrays, everyone is afraid to tell father what's going on. the sons and also their governess ingrid bergman. here's where the plot gets a little silly. bergman is introduced to us as a governess hired by baxter and wife fay wray for their kids. wray dies and baxter suffers some financial reversals in business. bergman has to be let go. she goes back to france and years later comes back to the family when the kids are grown up. <br /><br />i'm sorry, but i can't believe the kids need a governess now. hayward is quite right when she confronts her that it wasn't the kids who brought her back. in the normal course of things, bergman would have gotten on with her life. <br /><br />one of the previous reviewers said that a quarter to a third of the film i have was edited out. possibly that could be the reason for the many plot holes we have.<br /><br />it's too bad that ingrid and susan could not have done another film together in the fifties when hayward was at her heights and bergman had just made a comeback.<br /><br />susan hayward is the main reason to see adam had four sons. and i'm willing to believe that a good deal of ingrid was left on the cutting room floor.	1
i was very excited to see that they had made a movie out of my favorite book ever. i didn't realize it was disney until it was too late. i was appalled by the many omissions of crucial parts of the story. it was as if someone made a movie out of a 4th grader's book report on the novel. meg did well in school and neither her nor her father wore glasses. mrs murray (meg's mother) was not portrayed as much of a scientist at all; they left out her kitchen laboratory and replaced it with the internet. and that's just the beginning. by halfway through the movie i found myself shouting at the screen, much to the dismay of the other people who were watching the movie who hadn't read the book. i wish i had more thumbs so i could give four thumbs down for this one. the only good thing i can say is that for a person who has not read the book, this movie is kinda alright.	1
first of all, i am a huge fan of madeleine l'engle and was so excited to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books, a wrinkle in time. this movie, however, ruined that excitement for me. i am sorry, but meg was described in the book as having fizzy curls and glasses and as being considered very uncool. in the movie, she has straight hair and no glasses and is the ""sporty type"" with a deep voice. this is not how madeleine l'engle pictured meg to be at all. in fact, meg was based on madeleine's character and depicted the way she felt when she was young. this is just one major example how the book and movie are different. so i would say, if you want to watch it for entertainment purposes, watch it but if you are a devoted fan of madeleine l'engle and her wrinkle in time series, i would suggest skipping this movie.	1
after the success of scooby-doo, where are you, they decided to give scooby and shaggy their own show. but unfortunately, they added a new character that spoilt scooby-doo success forever. they invented a new show with a new title, scooby and scrappy-doo. it was scrappy-doo that made this show a complete failure, probably for both adults and kids together. scrappy was the stupid brave puppy that always looked ready to beat someone up. scooby and shaggy were getting scared of the villain, and they were also trying to stop him. scooby-doo doesn't need any little annoying bastard puppy nephews. if they wanted scooby-doo to be more successful, they should have either killed or never thought up scrappy. this was just poor, maybe your kids will prefer it!	1
we all know that some of the greatest movies of all time were based on books. while not particularly accurate adaptations, these movies were nonetheless excellent films. some great examples are the harry potter series, the lord of the rings trilogy, and, to a lesser extent, almost every disney film ever made. however, i must regretfully announce that a wrinkle in time is not one of those movies. not only does it fail to meet some of the most basic expectations of madeleine l'engle's fan base, it manages to defy the standards of scriptwriting, acting, special effects and, ultimately, respect for the audience. mind you, i'm not trying to be mean; on the contrary, i went into this affair with an open mind. i figured that a made-for-t.v. movie would make up for its lack of razzle-dazzle in its script. after all, the star wars spin-off ewoks was decent, if a little silly. come to think of it, the original star wars was made on ""a lunch money budget"", and look where it took george lucas! however, from the first scene onward, disappointment started enveloping me as if i'd gotten too close to the black thing while tessering. <br /><br />the same way greedo shooting first became the symbol of the star wars special edition of 1997 (a disaster of monumental proportions involving a disgruntled director making several hideous changes to a beloved classic), mrs. whatsit has officially become my personal symbol for the confusion and stupidity that is a wrinkle in time. the reason for this is the fact that she has been mutated beyond belief. aside from the slightly controversial decision of casting alfre woodard (star trek: first contact and radio) as our favorite star-turned-mentor, the filmmakers decided it appropriate to introduce her as a crow. that's right, a crow. moreover, the heavenly centaurion form of this greatly beloved character has been hacked at by what looks to be a demented eight-year-old; the majestic half-man, half-horse with wings has become a huge human head with a creepy smile mounted awkwardly on the bowlegged body of a horse that happens to be sporting a pair of wings in the middle. had i been five, this would have psychologically traumatized me for life. the worst part is the fact that when it spoke, it was shown from behind so as to avoid the responsibility to lip sync, resulting in a scene that was spent looking at the back of its head and seeing a single, unmoving cheek, thus rendering the piece of special effects less believable than e.t.<br /><br />having gotten the most painful part out of the way, i must go on to the tear-inducing one: the characters, the acting, and the story. i, personally, had always imagined meg to look somewhat similar to moaning myrtle from the harry potter films: plain hair, glasses, and a figure most supermodels would find laughable. she was always a slightly anxious, humorously pessimistic math genius who quite simply could not have cared less about the imports and exports of nicaragua. in the film, she is an unpleasant know-it-all for whom i have no sympathy whatsoever. in fact, she makes me feel sorry for poor mr. jenkins, her school principal, who continuously has to deal with her. calvin, the kind, intelligent kid who everyone thinks is a jock has becomea jock! the irony is horrible. as for the memorable happy medium, they took the pleasant old woman who liked to look at happy things and replaced her with a being who is ""above gender"" and likes to look at ""funny"" things, such as girls falling off of swings. the only three people i can think of who did a decent job are charles wallace, mrs. whatsit and the man with red eyes (nicknamed ""the dude with red eyes"" due to his complete reinvention as a character).<br /><br />the story is a mess. a good comparison to this aspect of the movie is harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban, which didn't do a good job of retelling the story found in the book, yet kept the sole of the original work. here, the sole of the book is having a pleasant chat with hades down in the underworld, apparently unaware that its body is being destroyed. as the dark lord complements the sole on how well it showed that truth has to be felt and not seen, the flat-nosed wookies of ixchel (who replace the wondrous beings who hold aunt beast among their ranks) tear the spine up. as the god of the dead notes how subtle the terror of the earth-like camazotz was, the torn pages are scattered in the sandstorm and lost in the darkness of the land of evil. <br /><br />i am very sorry that this film exists. i do not believe that the actors were genuinely bad. it's the way the characters are written that ruins it. a wrinkle in time deserved to be adapted by lawrence kasdan, directed by george lucas or steven spielberg, enhanced at industrial light and magic, scored by john williams, given its sound at skywalker sound, edited by thx and marketed by twentieth century fox. in its current state, the film is unworthy to be shown to self-respecting people. even madeleine l'engle thought it was bad. the book was good, the film was bad, and mrs. whatsit was ugly.<br /><br />score: 0.1/10 (if i could) <br /><br />pros:<br /><br />they got the names right. <br /><br />cons: <br /><br />it had horrible problems with the cliffs notes level of adaptation, script, acting and special effects, not to mention lack of evidence of ever having read the book. oh, and the main cover/poster has a picture of the three main characters riding a flying horse over a castle. some might say that this symbolizes high adventure. i say it symbolizes the irresponsibility of the cover artist who didn't even bother to photoshop meg's arm on properly.	1
this movie barely followed the story line of the movie. all of the fascinating points in the book didn't even exist in the movie. they ended up turning it into a cheesy ""tween"" disney movie ""crush"" story between meg and calvin. it was so bad it should have been hillary duff playing the part, or one of the likes. this movie was nothing more than an insult to the intelligence and mysticism of the book. i can't believe disney could even get away with making such a cheap, basic rendition. if you've ever read the book, i think you would agree it could easily be made into a movie of ""lord of the rings"" equivalence. this movie should have never been able to use the title of a wrinkle in time. poorly done.	1
i only recently found out that madeleine l'engle's novel had been turned into a tv movie by disney and ordered the dvd. the book was a favorite of mine when i was a child and i read it several times.<br /><br />despite some of the child actors not resembling the characters as described in the novel, the murry family is well cast, with a likable (if too pretty) meg at the center and a charles wallace who is convincing as a child prodigy without becoming irritating. <br /><br />the first half hour is promising enough, doing a good job in establishing the relationships between the lead characters and at setting the scene. unfortunately as soon as the non-human characters appear the adaptation starts to unravel and once the children leave earth the whole thing falls apart. alfre woodward is too youthful looking and much too regal as the eccentric mrs whatsit (think miriam margolis or joan plowright instead) and kate nelligan face is so mask like and inexpressive, she must have visited faye dunaway's plastic surgeon in recent years. for some reason they make her mrs which look like glinda from the wizard of oz when she should have resembled a benign wicked witch of the west.<br /><br />in the end what lets this down most badly are the terrible special effects and art direction. i understand that this is a tv movie, but the cgi looked like something that could have been done 15 years earlier. mrs whatsits' centaur incarnation is a disaster as is the chewbacca like suit for aunt beast, who in the novel is a velvety, elegant creature instead of the ungainly big foot like thing shown here. i could go on and on, nearly every artistic choice is a disaster, presumably because there wasn't a large enough budget to do this justice, but also because the design work lacks imagination and good judgement.<br /><br />this really would have needed the sense of wonder spielberg brought to his early films. what a shame that with the current popularity of adapting children's literary fantasy series nobody thought of adapting a wrinkle in time and it's sequels for the big screen, giving it the scope it deserves.	1
i have never read the book""a wrinkle in time"". to be perfectly honesty, after seeing the movie, do i really want to? well, i shouldn't be reviewing this movie i'll start off with that. next i'll say that the tv movie is pretty forgettable. do you know why i say that? because i forgot what happens in it. i told you it was forgettable. to be perfectly honest, no tv movie will ever be better than ""merlin"".<br /><br />how do i describe a tv movie? i have never written a review for one before. well, i'll just say that they usually have some celebrities. a wrinkle in time includes only one. alfre woodard(or woodward, i am not sure), the oscar winner. <br /><br />the film has cheesy special effects, a mildly interesting plot, scenes that make you go ""wtf"". the movie is incredibly bad and it makes you go""wtf"". what did i expect? it's a tv movie. they usually aren't good. as is this one. a wrinkle in time is a waste of time and a big time waster. to top it off, you'll most likely forget about it the second it's over. well, maybe not the second it's over. but within a few minutes.<br /><br />a wrinkle in time:*/****	1
i was browsing through netflix and stumbled upon this movie. having fond memories of the book as a child, i decided to check this out. this is a movie that you should really pass on.<br /><br />it is just not worth seeing. it is very boring and uninteresting. i feel that it would even be that way to small children. it has no magic that the book contains. this movie is not horrible, but you will just find yourself not caring ten minutes into it.<br /><br />there are moments that just come off as weird. the witch character is not very good. the family acts like it is no big deal that these odd things are happening. i know this is a kids movie, so as an older audience we must not look too deeply in things, but the whole movie just feels like it was written and produced by people who have never had any movie making experience before.<br /><br />the dvd that i had began skipping in the final moments of the film, and instead of trying to fix it i just turned it off and sent it back to netflix. i really didn't care how it finished. skip this film and read the book instead.	1
i have loved this book since my 5th grade teacher read it to our class many years ago. and i have read it to every one of my 3rd and 5th grade classes over my past 18 years of teaching. supposedly a movie had been made in the past, but i'd never been able to locate it. well, my students and i were all so excited when we heard that disney had brought madeline l'engle's excellent book to the screen. <br /><br />as i watched the movie, i had the highest of hopes. as the film went on, i became more and more despondent. they had botched it badly! never had i been so let down by a favorite book-to-film adaption. i understand that films can't stick strictly to a book, but they don't need to change things for the sake of it! most, if not all, of departures from the book were totally unnecessary! <br /><br />i kept my opinion to myself at first and just listened to my students discuss the movie. well, it wasn't just me. nearly every single one felt the same way--cheated out of the great story that madeline l'engle had so skillfully created! <br /><br />why, they wondered, did aunt beast look like chewbacca from the star wars movie? why couldn't calvin's hair have been red? why did mrs. which not have the proper ""witch-like"" outfit that was such a clever play on her name? basically, we all wondered--why did nearly every single detail have to be changed? <br /><br />i have always dreamed of how wonderful a movie this book would make. i am still waiting for that movie. this one was a wrinkle in time in only the broadest of senses. i'm going to write to peter jackson and try to convince him to take on the task!	1
(this may be a bit on the spoilerish side) i would like to start by saying i did not watch the entire movie, nor could i because it was evident from the first hour that i was going to be incredibly disappointed. that of course is the problem with taking, what many believe to be an amazing book, and turning it into a disney made-for-tv movie.<br /><br />a wrinkle in time should have been made into an amazing movie a long time ago. it's got a great storyline that could hook children and adults. plus it's got built in quality sequels. but disney-fying was not the way to go. the problem with the movie is that all the things they changed to turn it into a visual story dumbed down what was so great about the book. it is a complicated and emotional story for kids. there was no reason to make charles wallace purely ""psychic"", because that was the easiest way of explaining it. there was no reason to write a fight between the three mrs. w's as added tension, there is enough tension in the story without that. there was no reason to remove meg's glasses... that deprived us of what could've been a very sweet scene between calvin and meg that happens in the book.<br /><br />i could nitpick for days about little things, but i also think larger things, like the art direction was a off. take for instance the way they made camazotz look, with its strangely darkened skies. the creepiness that comes across in the book is that camazotz could be earth. it looks like earth. it has people on it that look like humans. the skies are blue, the grass is green, and there are children playing. but something is a little bit off. the directors chose to make camazotz a complete other instead of taking the lesson in the book and applying it to the overall direction of the movie. the lesson of course is that camazotz could very well be earth, that is if we forget how to love. it would've been much creepier to have a beautiful afternoon as they're walking down the street with the kids bouncing the balls in the same rhythm.<br /><br />i unfortunately did not watch the end. maybe someone can tell me how disney messed up the end as well.<br /><br />overall an artistic disappointment.<br /><br />	1
i really didn't like this movie because it didn't really bring across the messages and ideas l'engle brought out in her novel. we had read the novel in our english class and i absolutely loved it, i'm afraid i can't say the same for the film. there were some serious differences between the novel and the adapted version and it just didn't do any credit to the imaginative genius that is madeleine l'engle! this is the reason i gave it such a poor rating. don't see this movie if you are a big fan of l'engle's texts because you will be sorely disappointed. however, if you are watching the movie for entertainment purposes (or educational as was my case) then it is an alright movie!	1
i have read the whole 'a wrinkle in time' book and then saw the movie. the movie contained all the elements in the book but since the book was 190 pages and the film was 2 hours it felt really crammed in with too many effects and bad acting.<br /><br />a wrinkle in time is about a girl named meg, charles wallace, and calvin must team together to find meg's father and get off the island camazotz. <br /><br />the beginning of the film is really a stinker. the acting is awful, the direction is laughable, and so far the situations aren't necessary. i really was crushed to see the same person madeleine engle that wrote the book and created the movie, made a great book, and a terrible film. the acting is worse than any straight-to-video acting. yes, i got to admit there was cool effects. but seriously they were all done terribly and not serial in any way possible. if you read the book you will be crushed by the movie. i wish could give it a 0 but sadly i can only give it 1. a half could have been useful.	1
the ""wrinkle in time"" book series is my favorite series from childhood. i have read and re-read them more times than i can count over the last 35+ years. the characters, with all their virtues and flaws, are near and dear to my heart. this adaptation contained very little of the wonderful, magical, spiritual story that i love so much. to say i was disappointed with this film would be a great understatement.<br /><br />if you have never read the book(s) i imagine you will enjoy the movie. the acting is passable, the special effects are well done for a made for tv movie, and the story is interesting. however, if you love the books, avoid this movie at all costs.<br /><br />i found this statement at the wikipedia page of the novel: ""in an interview with newsweek, l'engle said of the film, 'i expected it to be bad, and it is.'""<br /><br />i, like another reviewer here, feel the need to read the book again to dispel this movie from my mind.	1
i got all excited when i saw the ads for this movie because i recently read the b"	1
film starts in 1840 japan in which a man slashes his wife and her lover to death and the commits suicide. it's a very gory, bloody sequence. then it jumps to present day...well 1982 to be precise. ted (edward albert), wife laura (susan george) and their annoying little kid move to japan for hubby's work. they rent a house and--surprise! surprise--it just happens to be the house where the murders took place! the three dead people are around as ghosts (the makeup is hysterically bad) and make life hell for the family.<br /><br />sounds ok--but it's really hopeless. there's a bloody opening and ending and nothing happens in between. there is an attack by giant crabs which is just uproarious! they look so fake--i swear i saw the strings pulling one along--and they're muttering!!!!! there's a pointless sex sequence in the first 20 minutes (probably just to show off george's body), another one about 40 minutes later (but that was necessary to the plot) and a really silly exorcism towards the end. the fight scene between albert and doug mcclure must be seen to be believed.<br /><br />as for acting--albert was ok as the husband and mcclure was pretty good as a family friend. but george--as always--is terrific in a lousy film. she gives this film a much needed lift--but can't save it. i'm giving this a 2 just for her and the gory opening and closing. that aside, this is a very boring film.	1
"that this poor excuse for an amateur hour showcase was heralded at sundance is a great example of what is wrong with most indie filmmakers these days.<br /><br />first of all, there is such a thing as the art of cinematography. just picking up a 16mm camera and pointing it at whomever has a line does not make for a real movie.<br /><br />i guess we have to consider ourselves lucky the director didn't pick up someone's camcorder...<br /><br />second, indie films are supposed to be about real people. there's nothing real in this film. none of the characters come across as being even remotely human.<br /><br />what they come across as being is figments of the imagination of a writer trying to impress his buddies by showing them how ""cool and edgy"" he is.<br /><br />sorry, but this is not good writing, or good directing.<br /><br />what is left is a husk of a bad movie that somehow made its way to sundance. hard to believe this was one of the best films submitted...<br /><br />in any case, it made me loose what was left of my respect for the sundance brand."	1
i don't think anyone sitting down to view this film would be expecting anything remotely appearing like a classic ghost story but you have to ask yourself when it's over if you were ever scared. this doesn't really work on that level but the cast does try hard and the film doesn't tack on one of those happy endings. story is about an american couple who travel to kyoto, japan so that ted fletcher (edward albert) can write a book and he brings along his wife laura (susan george) and their daughter amy (amy barrett). their friend alex curtis (doug mcclure) who works at the american consulate helps them find a house to live in and he finds one that is haunted. about 140 years earlier in the same house a samurai found his wife cheating on him and he kills both of them and then commits suicide. their ghosts still inhabit the house and when the fletcher's arrive it doesn't take long before strange things start happening.<br /><br />*****spoiler alert*****<br /><br />at times the ghosts inhabit the bodies of the fletcher's and they start to act like the japanese people that they were before and laura starts to flirt with alex which leads to an affair. meanwhile, ted starts behaving more strict and after he pours soup down the throat of amy he goes to ask a monk for help. unfortunately the ghosts get ted, laura, and alex to play out their death scene like it happened 140 years earlier.<br /><br />this film was directed by kevin connor who is known as a good television director but he has made horror and science fiction films before and has worked with mcclure on some of them. while this never comes close to being scary or developing atmosphere it does have two things in it that i liked. first, it doesn't have one of those sappy endings where the couple embrace after defeating the demons. instead, it ends in a very bloody fight where everyone succumbs to the evil of the ghosts. secondly, it has susan george in the cast! i've always been a fan of hers even though she has appeared in mostly schlock but her performances are always top notch. also she usually appears nude which she does here in two separate scenes and while she doesn't have classic features she does have a unique tomboy like look about her and it's one of the reasons why she was so popular. but after appearing in silly films such as this i think it led to her getting out of the business or working only sporadically. this isn't a bad film but it's never convincing and watching the ghosts scurry around when the monk gives an exorcism is practically worthy of a giggle or two. the bottom line is that this is silly and i hope george decides to resume her career.	1
dull haunted house thriller finds an american family moving into a 200 year old house in japan where a violent murder suicide love triangle occurred. <br /><br />novel setting is about the only element of interest in this very slow moving horror flick by the director of motel hell. the film generates zero suspense and is composed of somewhat choppy scenes that rarely seem to be leading anywhere overall. <br /><br />one obvious example is a fairly early scene where the male lead visits a temple after realizing that his house is haunted as the monk had earlier warned. the monk recounts the history of the house (which the viewer is already familiar with from the opening sequence) and then the film simply cuts away to something else. earlier the monk had offered to help. well, where is the help? the family continues to stay in the haunted house as things get worse and worse and no mention of the monk is made until nearly the very end when he turns up again to do what he should have done an hour earlier--try to drive the spirits out of the house, although by this time it's difficult for the viewers to care.<br /><br />there are some (probably) unintentional campy laughs in seeing the american actors at the end become possessed by the japanese spirits and suddenly start doing bad martial arts, i say probably because the scene is more than a little reminiscent of the chainsaw duel from the same director's motel hell which was more obviously meant to be amusing, but on the whole this is a forgettable dud.	1
the film opens with a peaceful shot of a traditional japanese house complete with thatched roof that sits on the side of a small hill and an on screen caption appears that reads 'kushiata kyoto, japan 1840'. a young japanese trainee samurai named masanori (toshiya maruyama) walks up the winding path to the house, inside waits otami (mako hattori) with whom he is having an affair behind her husband, shugoro's (tsuiyuki sasaki as toshiyuki sasaki) back who happens to be masanori's teacher. shugoro unexpectedly arrives home to find his wife and student having very intimate relations with each other. his honour destroyed the enraged samurai brutally murders both otami and masanori before committing suicide. over a century later and ted fletcher (edward albert) arrives in japan on a working holiday with his wife laura (susan george) and their young daughter amy (amy barrett). their close friend alex curtis (doug mcclure) who works for the american consulate helps them out by finding them a place to stay, you don't need me to you where! he jokingly says it's going so cheap because it's haunted, to which both ted and laura laugh off as they obviously don't believe in ghosts, at least for the time being that is. almost immediately the film goes into cliché mode. lights turn on and off by themselves, laura has an uneasy feeling about the place and a local zen monk (henry mitowa) gives them an ominous warning for them to leave before it's too late which they ignore, of course. the spirits of otami, masanori and shugoro were doomed for eternity to remain within the walls of the house because of a majyo witches (tsuyako olajima) curse put upon them. but there may be a way they can break the curse, unfortunately for the fletcher family it could potentially cost them their marriage, daughter and possibly even their very lives. <br /><br />directed by kevin connor i thought this was a pretty average film, ok to watch once if you've got nothing better to do but after a day or two you'll probably have completely forgotten it. nothing sticks in the memory as being particularly bad but on the other hand there's nothing particularly good about the film either. the script by robert suhosky from the novel by james hardiman is a little on the dull side and strictly by-the-numbers, a lot of ghostly goings on happen throughout the film but none of it is very interesting or exciting and the flat characters and direction doesn't help things. there are couple of silly sequences like the giant plastic crabs that try to get amy and her babysitter, noriko (mayumi umeda). and there is a scene where the zen monk exorcises the house and the ghosts are banished outside unable to get back in, however that is until ted simply opens the door and they just walk right back in, some exorcism! one more thing, i think it was a bad idea to have doug mcclure who was 47 when he made this, try his hand at kung-fu and oriental sword fighting! george gets her ample breasts out a couple of times including a very unerotic sex scene with mcclure, although great pains and a couple of bed sheets that stick to them like super glue were taken to ensure no below the waist nudity was present. apart from a couple of mostly off screen decapitations there's no blood, gore or violence to speak about. the 'transparent' ghost effects are ok but they ain't going to impress many people these days. it's professionally enough made and looks quite nice but the potential in the japanese setting and myths is squandered as this film could have been set in america, england or any western country without having to change a thing. an ok time waster.	1
this can be one of the most enjoyable movies ever if you don't take it seriously. it is a bit dated and the effects are lame, but it is so enjoyable. there are giant crabs that attack a girl. oh, and the crabs sing japanese. it is amazingly bad. and the ending, which has been telegraphed throughout the entire film is hideously awesome. predictable, but seeing the final fight will leave you rolling in your seat. don't even give this film a chance and you will love it. susan george is fun to watch and yes, she does appear naked. her daughter isn't quite worth putting up with, but she does get attacked by giant crabs. they are the size of large cats. this is a 2, but i love it. as a movie, my god, but for entertainment, i give it a 7. did i mention there are giant crabs?	1
..it's this one! very cool premise, right off the bat.<br /><br />has an excellent first scene, gotta give credit where credit's due.<br /><br />has solid characters and a decent enough script for a ghost story but here are the things that bothered me: whenever the ghosts appeared, which i really liked by the way; how it was done, how it looked...the only thing was the ghost's relationship. because of the way things went down in the first scene you'd think their dynamic would be different.<br /><br />things slowed down a little too much in the middle i felt, and the crab/spider scene was just not good. but then the ending is actually very good! sure, 'the grudge' basically told the same story with a polished lens but no samurai's and that's what i liked about this movie comparatively.<br /><br />please, someone one with a tempered style remake this movie.<br /><br />fans of 'silent rage' would absolutely love this movie.	1
"at the beginning of the film, you might double-check the dvd cover and re-read the synopsis a couple of times, but no worries. it's not ""memoirs of a geisha"" that you purchased; just a movie with an intro that is much more classy and stylish than it has any right to be. still, the opening is by far the best thing about the entire movie, as it shows how in the year 1840 a samurai sword master catches his wife committing adultery. he decapitates the two lovers before doing some hara-kiri (ritual suicide through disembowelment). cut to present day, when the american ambassador in japan welcomes a befriended family and drives them up to the same house where the aforementioned slaughter took place nearly one and a half century ago. from then onwards, this becomes a seemingly routine haunted house flick yet the utterly retarded and implausible script still makes it somewhat exceptional. let's start with the good aspects, namely the original japanese setting and the presence of the delicious susan george who is my all-time favorite british horror wench (well, together with britt eckland, linda hayden and ingrid pitt). the bad aspects simply include that the screenplay is incoherent, imbecilic beyond repair and full of supposedly unsettling twists that only evoke laughter. the restless spirits of the house soon begin to entertain themselves by perpetrating into the bodies of the new tenants and causing them to do and say all sorts of crazy stuff. the spirit of the massacred adulterous woman particularly enjoys squeezing into susan's ravishing booty and transforming her into a lewd seductress! in this ""possessed"" state, she even lures the american ambassador outside to have sex in the garden of a high society diner party full of prominent guests. so, strictly spoken, it's not really ""evil"" that dwells in the house; just a trio of sleazy ghosts with dirty minds and far too much free time on their long-dead hands! obviously these scenes are more comical than frightening, especially since the light-blue and transparent shapes remind you of the cute ghost effects that were later popularized in ""ghostbusters"". ""the house where evil dwells"" is probably the least scary ghost movie ever. throughout most of the running time, you'll be wondering whether director kevin connor (who nevertheless made the excellent horror films ""motel hell"" and ""from beyond the grave"") intentionally wanted to make his movie funny and over-the-top, like ""motel hell"" maybe. but then again, everyone in the cast continues to speak his/her lines with a straight and sincere face, so i guess we are nevertheless supposed to take everything seriously and feel disturbed. ""the house where evil dwells"" is never suspenseful or even remotely exciting and it doesn't even contain any grisly images apart from the massacre at the beginning. i am fully aware of how shallow it sounds, but the two scenes in which susan george goes topless are the only true highlights. well, those and maybe also the invasion of cheesy and ridiculously over-sized spiders (or are they crabs?) in the daughter's bedroom. how totally random and irrelevant was that? if you ever decide to give this movie a chance notwithstanding its bad reputation, make sure you leave your common sense and reasoning at the doorstep.<br /><br />trivia note for horror buffs: keep an eye open for the demon-mask that was also a pivot piece of scenery in the brilliant japanese horror classic onibaba."	1
this could have been interesting  a japan-set haunted house story from the viewpoint of a newly-installed american family  but falls flat due to an over-simplified treatment and the unsuitability of both cast and director.<br /><br />the film suffers from the same problem i often encounter with the popular modern renaissance of such native fare, i.e. the fact that the spirits demonstrate themselves to be evil for no real reason other than that they're expected to! besides, it doesn't deliver much in the scares department  a giant crab attack is merely silly  as, generally, the ghosts inhabit a specific character and cause him or her to act in a totally uncharacteristic way, such as susan george seducing diplomat/friend-of-the-family doug mcclure and edward albert force-feeding his daughter a bowl of soup! <br /><br />at one point, an old monk turns up at the house to warn albert of the danger if they remain there  eventually, he's called upon to exorcise the premises. however, history is bound to repeat itself and tragedy is the only outcome of the tense situation duly created  leading to a violent yet unintentionally funny climax in which albert and mcclure, possessed by the spirits of their japanese predecessors, engage in an impromptu karate duel to the death! at the end of the day, this emerges an innocuous time-waster  tolerable at just 88 minutes but, in no way, essential viewing.	1
giant crabs cursing in japanese? what was in that drink? a terrible movie, but laughable. i love the invisible samurai ghosties running around. drink much beer before you see this movie.	1
"from reading all of the comments posted here on imdb, this movie seems to get ragged on a lot, but i didn't think it was that bad. i've seen much worse, actually.<br /><br />""the house where evil dwells"" is a ghost story about a husband and his wife, ted and laura fletcher, and their daughter, amy, who move into an old house in japan. little do they know, a japanese ninja brutally murdered his wife and her lover, and then killed himself 100 years earlier with a samurai sword. as strange things happen in the house, the ghosts of the previous residents begin to possess the bodies of the living, and plan on re-enacting the bloody murder that took place 100 years back.<br /><br />i saw this movie and decided to give it a chance, from the cover it looked like a decent ghost story. it was routine, and it was corny, but i've seen worse in my day. the ghost sequences were a little over-done, we get to see the translucent blue-tinted figures randomly pop up randomly around the family, and take over their bodies. to be honest, the ghosts in this movie kind of reminded me of the ghosts in the haunted mansion ride at disneyland. i may be mistaken, but after watching this, it seemed to me that the japanese horror film ""ju-on: the grudge"" and the american remake of that film ripped this off a little. the old japanese home where a brutal murder took place, ghostly activity, curses put on the home, etc. but i may be wrong.<br /><br />to sum it up, this is a pretty corny ghost story. don't go out of your way to see it, but if you like this kind of thing and it happens to come on tv you can give it a shot. 4/10."	1
"director kevin connor and wannabe action-hero / romantic lead doug mcclure, re-team in this ghost story set in japan. they had been moderately successful together in the 1970's, with the likes of 'the land that time forgot' (1975), 'at the earth's core' (1976) etc. without plastic monsters to carry the narrative along though, the results are shabby and derivative in the most corny way.<br /><br />the film begins with a prologue set in the 19th century, with a samurai husband killing his wife and her lover before committing suicide. a move forward to the present introduces married couple ted & laura, visiting japan and moving in to the house where the tragedy took place.<br /><br />no surprises as to what happens next, with the spirits of the dead starting to take over the new inhabitants with family friend alex (mcclure) assuming the role of the wife's lover.<br /><br />everything rumbles clumsily along with the elegance and grace of a charging elephant, to an inevitable ( but surprisingly downbeat ) conclusion. main points of interest are two feeble decapitations ( 'the omen' has a lot to answer for in promoting this as a standard horror set-piece ), and the love-making scenes featuring the doe-eyed but extremely kinky susan george. the first is a long 'don't look now' inspired piece with her hubby, complete with piano music; the second a much shorter (probably at her insistence) entanglement with mcclure, both looking pretty uncomfortable. anyway, every cloud has a silver lining and both scenes show of her fantastic knockers so all is not lost.<br /><br />overall i can't decide whether 'the house where evil dwells' is rubbish, watchable rubbish, or entertaining in a masochistic kind of way. if you're not into the genre there is nothing here at all, but for horror fans there is probably enough to provoke the odd rye smile and appreciative nod of respect for effort.<br /><br />best scene - in any other film the big, black, tree-climbing, japanese-muttering mechanical crabs would have stolen the show. they are eclipsed though by the legendary family meal scene, where a ghostly head appears in the daughters soup. on seeing this apparition she asks what kind of soup it is (!!!!), to be told beef and vegetable, before uttering the immortal line ""ugh - there's an awful face in my soup"". if this wasn't enough the reply is ""c'mon, eat your soup for daddy."" laurel & hardy rest in piece."	1
"raising victor vargas is just a bad film. no amount of denial or ad-dollar supported publicity with change this sad fact.<br /><br />maybe peter sollett saw he didn't have the money to do the movie he wanted to make and decided to take the easy way out by making a bad film that cynically apes the tenets of current ""edgy film-making"". maybe he just doesn't know any better. it's hard to tell.<br /><br />what's not hard to tell is the result. except for a few viewers who will intellectualize the bad film-making into an attempt at pseudo-realism, few will enjoy it.<br /><br />i know i didn't.<br /><br />do yourselves a favor and pass on this film."	1
i just rented and watched this movie just to see what's all the fuss about. so here's what my reactions to it are. it's easily seen that this is a low budget film with poor actors. the main plot of this movie is about a woman getting revenge on her rapists. this concept if done right could easily turn out to be a really provocative film. however, the movie doesn't shock or disturb me at all. it just bored me. this movie could be easily shortened to under 45 minutes. all lot of scenes are mainly there to fill in time, like those scenery scenes and some scenes i described below.<br /><br />************contains spoiler************ i find the rape scenes quite tame. i don't know if i have watched the cut or uncut version, if there is actually such a version. i also found many plot holes within the already badly written plot. here's a list on top of my mind.<br /><br />why don't the rapists rape jennifer during the night when she walked out her house to find out what those noise are. that would be an excellent time.<br /><br />why don't they just gang rape her, instead of delaying some of the rapists the pleasure and lengthening jennifer's ordeal by such a long time. it would probably be more shocking and disturbing that way.<br /><br />i found it really stupid that the rapists left her in the forest and head back to her house. maybe to show that these rapists are really imbeciles.<br /><br />these rapists should at least know that if you want to do a dirty job right, they shouldn't send a coward imbecile to do the job.<br /><br />why didn't jennifer call the police when the rapists finally left? which should be the first thing that pops up in most people's mind, especially for someone who is a writer. <br /><br />why didn't these rapists smell danger miles away when they saw jennifer is alive?<br /><br />i find it really amazing that a slender lady like camille can pull a man up a tree and hang him. ************************ends spoiler************<br /><br />but hey, this movie is not without its merits, camille keaton is gorgeous and i get to hear one of the funniest line i have recently heard when matthew protest of going back into the house and kills jennifer, `why me? why me, i didn't even c^m!!!'	1
i've seen the gator bait films, and this is almost exactly the same thing as those. a woman is sexually assaulted by a group of degenerate men and systematically exacts her vicious revenge on each of them. the thing that sets this movie apart from those ones (although not very far) is that the sexual content is not glorified. there is full frontal nudity many times throughout the film, but not for a second is it ever sexy. some of the rape scenes might seem a little extensive, but that's only because the movie is trying to strengthen the audience's need to see this woman seek revenge.<br /><br />this is a weak film, it has no other way to maintain interest other than manipulating our natural desire to see this woman get revenge on her attackers. i spit on your grave is not the kind of movie that you expect to deliver a serious moral, but i was glad to see that, since it contained a significant amount of violence inflicted upon the female lead, it was not meant to pass off as a t&a film.<br /><br />b-movies are notorious for being driven by nudity and out of control adolescent sexuality, and while i spit on you grave is unmistakably a b-movie and contains more than its share of nudity, the nudity does not drive the plot. on the other hand, the only thing that drives the plot is an empty necessity for revenge against a group of rapists. these men are evolutionary drop-outs just like they were in the gator bait films, and the biggest challenge for the writers seems to have been to come up with new and exciting ways to kill them, but the reason the film can never be anything more than a meaningless b-movie is because it does not deliver a message of any kind, but instead it simply satisfies the audience's desire to see a bunch of rapists get exactly what they deserve. <br /><br />the one problem that this leaves is that we have to sit through the sexual attacks. oddly, the first half of the film is the part that contains the most nudity (although not by much), but it is by far the most painful to watch. we are even let down a little as we watch the woman obtain revenge since a couple of the deaths were so elaborate that they were obviously impossible (it seems like pure luck that the guy in the lake at the end felt such an overwhelming desire to hug the motor on the boat and press his genitalia against the propeller, staying that way while the woman yells some final words at him and pulls the cord), but again, this movie satisfies only the desire for revenge that the first half filled us with.<br /><br />(spoilers) you know that this is all the movie means to do, since it literally ends the minute the last guy is killed. the woman does not live happily ever after, she doesn't write her book, she doesn't leave and never return to that nightmare place, she just gets in the boat and motors around the lake while the movie simply stops in its tracks. but hey, what more did you expect?<br /><br />oh, and did you read the tagline? if you decide to waste your time watching this, try and find any man getting broken or burned. i was really looking forward to those	1
i'm not going to bother with a plot synopsis since you know what the movie is about and there's almost no plot, anyway. i've seen several reviewers call isoyg an 'anti-rape' film or even a feminist statement, and i just have to chime in on the galling hypocrisy of these claims.<br /><br />first of all, what do we see on the cover of this movie? that's right: a shapely woman's behind. whether it was zarchi's attempt to make an anti-rape statement - and i absolutely don't believe it was - is entirely beside the point. the film is marketing sex and the titillation of sexual assault and the material is so graphic (everything but actual penetration is shown) that no one but the hard core exploitation crowd will enjoy it.<br /><br />the rape(s) in the film is uncomfortable, brutal and hard to watch. there's something to be said for presenting a horrible crime in such a brutal light, but there was no reason for this scene to go on for seemingly 30 minutes, none. there was also little character development of the victim and only one of the rapists is slightly developed (mere moments before he's murdered) so the scene isn't at all engaging on an emotional level. really, it's just presented for the sake of showing extreme sexual violence and you can tell by the movies isoyg is associated with on imdb (caligula, cannibal ferox, etc.) that it attracts only the exploitation crowd.<br /><br />finally, a few reviewers have commended zarchi's so-called documentary style and lack of a soundtrack. but considering how inept everything else in the film is (acting, script, etc.) i suspect these were financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary because he literally stationed a camera and let his porn-caliber actors do their thing.<br /><br />i'm not going to get all up on my high horse talking about the content of isoyg. i'm all for exploitation / horror and love video nasties. in fact, i'm giving this movie three stars only because it truly does push the envelope so much further than some other films. however, it's also poorly made and after the rape occurs, just downright boring for the rest of the film as we watch a bunch of ho-hum, mostly gore-less murders and wait for the credits to roll.<br /><br />this is probably worth watching once if you're a hardcore 70s exploitation fan but i'm telling you, the movie is overall pretty bad and not really worth its notorious reputation.	1
"okay, you have:<br /><br />penelope keith as miss herringbone-tweed, b.b.e. (backbone of england.) she's killed off in the first scene - that's right, folks; this show has no backbone!<br /><br />peter o'toole as ol' colonel cricket from the first war and now the emblazered lord of the manor.<br /><br />joanna lumley as the ensweatered lady of the manor, 20 years younger than the colonel and 20 years past her own prime but still glamourous (brit spelling, not mine) enough to have a toy-boy on the side. it's alright, they have col. cricket's full knowledge and consent (they guy even comes 'round for christmas!) still, she's considerate of the colonel enough to have said toy-boy her own age (what a gal!)<br /><br />david mccallum as said toy-boy, equally as pointlessly glamourous as his squeeze. pilcher couldn't come up with any cover for him within the story, so she gave him a hush-hush job at the circus.<br /><br />and finally:<br /><br />susan hampshire as miss polonia teacups, venerable headmistress of the venerable girls' boarding-school, serving tea in her office with a dash of deep, poignant advice for life in the outside world just before graduation. her best bit of advice: ""i've only been to nancherrow (the local stately home of england) once. i thought it was very beautiful but, somehow, not part of the real world."" well, we can't say they didn't warn us.<br /><br />ah, susan - time was, your character would have been running the whole show. they don't write 'em like that any more. our loss, not yours.<br /><br />so - with a cast and setting like this, you have the re-makings of ""brideshead revisited,"" right?<br /><br />wrong! they took these 1-dimensional supporting roles because they paid so well. after all, acting is one of the oldest temp-jobs there is (you name another!)<br /><br />first warning sign: lots and lots of backlighting. they get around it by shooting outdoors - ""hey, it's just the sunlight!""<br /><br />second warning sign: leading lady cries a lot. when not crying, her eyes are moist. that's the law of romance novels: leading lady is ""dewy-eyed.""<br /><br />henceforth, leading lady shall be known as l.l.<br /><br />third warning sign: l.l. actually has stars in her eyes when she's in love. still, i'll give emily mortimer an award just for having to act with that spotlight in her eyes (i wonder . did they use contacts?)<br /><br />and lastly, fourth warning sign: no on-screen female character is ""mrs."" she's either ""miss"" or ""lady.""<br /><br />when all was said and done, i still couldn't tell you who was pursuing whom and why. i couldn't even tell you what was said and done.<br /><br />to sum up: they all live through world war ii without anything happening to them at all.<br /><br />ok, at the end, l.l. finds she's lost her parents to the japanese prison camps and baby sis comes home catatonic. meanwhile (there's always a ""meanwhile,"") some young guy l.l. had a crush on (when, i don't know) comes home from some wartime tough spot and is found living on the street by lady of the manor (must be some street if she's going to find him there.) both war casualties are whisked away to recover at nancherrow (somebody has to be ""whisked away"" somewhere in these romance stories!)<br /><br />great drama."	1
with knightly and o'tool as the leads, this film had good possibilities, and with mccallum as the bad guy after knightly, maybe some tension. but they threw it all away on silly evening frill and then later on with maudlin war remnants. it was of course totally superficial, beautiful english country and seaside or not.the number one mistake was dumping knightly so early on in the film, when she could easily have played someone a couple of years older, instead of choosing someone ten years older to play the part. they missed all the chances to have great conflict among the cast, and instead stupidly pulled at the easy and low-cost heartstring elements.	1
quite what the producers of this appalling adaptation were trying to do is impossible to fathom.<br /><br />a group of top quality actors, in the main well cast (with a couple of notable exceptions), who give pretty good performances. penelope keith is perfect as aunt louise and equally good is joanna lumley as diana. all do well with the scripts they were given.<br /><br />so much for the good. the average would include the sets. nancherrow is nothing like the house described in the book, although bizarrely the house they use for the dower house looks remarkably like it. it is clear then that the dower house is far too big. in the later parts, the writers decided to bring the entire story back to the uk, presumably to save money, although with a little imagination i have no doubt they could have recreated ceylon.<br /><br />now to the bad. the screenplay. this is such an appallingly bad adaptation is hard to find words to condemn it. edward does not die in the battle of britain but survives, blinded. he makes a brief appearance then commits suicide - why?? loveday has changed from the young woman totally in love with gus to a sensible farmer's wife who can give up the love her life with barely a tear (less emotional than brief encounter). gus, a man besotted and passionately in love, is prepared to give up his love without complaint. walter (mudge in the book) turns from a shallow unfaithful husband to a devoted family man. jess is made into a psychologically disturbed young woman who won't speak. aunt biddy still has a drink problem but now without any justification. the dower house is occupied by the army for no obvious reason other than a very short scene with jess who has a fear of armed soldiers. whilst miss mortimer's breasts are utterly delightful, i could not see how their display on several occasions moved the plot forward. the delightfully named nettlebed becomes the mundane dobson. the word limit prevents me from continuing the list.<br /><br />there is a sequel (which i lost all interest in watching after this nonsense) and i wonder if the changes were made to create the follow on story. it is difficult to image that rosamunde pilcher would have approved this grotesque perversion of her book; presumably she lost her control when the rights were purchased.	1
simply not the quality i expected from morris (love brass eye and blue jam). this is very much like a not so bad student film. what concerns me, in all this is why did it win a bafta??? morris makes fun of 'enshrined mediocrity' (ayn rand) in much of his work (nathan barley) and yet with this piece is urinating down the backs of the talented and telling us its raining! <br /><br />i just hope as he has chosen a subject i would love to tackle (the humanity of terrorism - four lions) that he isn't going to cock that up, wasting the opportunity to make a statement about the farce of mainstream ignorance and opinion on this emotive and heavily spun phenomena.	1
there's nothing wrong with a popcorn movie to keep you off the streets. it's just that some are better than others. this is very poor. the acting is awful, the script dire; and the special effects overrated.<br /><br />why does hollywood treat it's audience with such contempt? and why have they made a sequel?	1
one of the major flaws in this film is that while the mocking of pretentious yuppies is satisfying, it fails to realize that the movie makers themselves are guilty of being one of those that deserve to be mocked. one of the characteristics of these yuppie types is the conceited misunderstanding that they (the yuppies) are the only ones sophisticated enough to understand art. while the movie ignores this characteristic and instead focuses on their misunderstandings of dinning, i find it ironic that only people who enjoy this movie boast the same conceited taste in films as the characters do in their choice of dinner. if these pompous characters that were in this movie have a video library at home, i would bet that american psycho would be one of those movies.	1
"this ""film"" is one of the most dreadful things i have ever seen.<br /><br />please do yourselves a favor and avoid this incompetent concoction.<br /><br />shaking the camera and having your actors adopt scowls does not count as ""direction"", which this film needed in droves. not that the writing was all the wonderful, rather we were left with a bunch of completely artificial characters directed in that most artificial way (the pseudo-documentary ""style"" prized by those who don't know how to direct).<br /><br />this film gives the impression that it was done cynically to appeal to critics who don't know the first thing about film-making (which is most of them).<br /><br />just terrible. it says a lot about sundance and what it's become that victor vargas was showcased there."	1
"without wishing to be a killjoy, brad sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clichéd films i've ever seen - this being one of them, and camp blood being another. <br /><br />the acting is terrible, the print is shoddy, and everything about this film screams ""seriously, you could do better yourself"". maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap?<br /><br />i bought this for £1, but remember, you can't put a price on 71 minutes of your life. you'd do well to avoid this turkey, even at a bargain basement price."	1
enough is enough...sometimes they just need to stop making movies based on a concept that is long dead. the first tremors movie was great. the second one was ridiculous. the third one was nauseating. the tv series was depressingly awful. and this movie just drives the stake deeper.<br /><br />basically another excuse for cheap computer effects and puppetry, now we have the series set in the wild west, in the 1800's, and they fight graboids. like a rehash of the first one, they have to learn how to beat them all over again. mildly entertaining i suppose. otherwise this straight-to-video release, just like tremors 2 and 3, is just going way too far. oh and i continue to wonder how there is never any record of these events taking place...did they just simply forget to record this unprecedented event? i think something like this would be history-making, so our pals in the first film wouldn't be so unprepared. <br /><br />movies like this that ruin the original just make me crazy. avoid this garbage.	1
"dear dear dear dear dear...me! i had the strength to see it through... but why?!<br /><br />the first two films where fun and actually somewhat good. but this is so bad we had problems seeing the whole thing. this was some kind of tremors for kids. i can't believe this movie was made at all..seems like the props where taken from some bad western series of some kind (for kids) and they just did whatever they could with it.<br /><br />what audience is this movie for? i can only think of 12-14 year olds. if you're older than 14 you'll have serious problems with this movie. it's not only slow, but it's so utterly boring. the characters are overacted (not just a little either) and so stereotyped it's fun for a while..but not long enough to not make you want to fling tomatoes at the screen. you know everything that is going to happen too, cause yes...you've seen it a billion times before in any hero series on tv for kids. i picked all the survivors and all the tremor fodder the second the characters got introduced. it's so bad..so wrong..so...crap.<br /><br />but ok, we did get a laugh now and then. not just at the silly plot holes, but some scenes where worth a replay or two...or one scene that is, where two baby tremors fling themselves at one of the obvious tremor fodder guys..it's really a great scene which made us replay it over and over and laugh wholeheartedly. still makes me grin when i think about it. but that only happened one more time sadly..and that's when the ""badass"" gunman shows up and overacts his part wonderfully...that and one comment ""they spring from the ground like some demonic trout!"" at this point we where almost crying with laughter. but after that..nothing could ever top that..(?)..so it's pretty much downhill from there. <br /><br />so tops here are demonic trouts and overacting. if anybody ever tells you this is a good movie...he's either a ""plant"", vegetable or someone very evil. this movie has got to be the worst of the tremors by far. looking forward to seeing tremors 3, it's bound to be box office hit compared to this...this...*goosebumps* no..i'll leave it at that."	1
"well...tremors i, the original started off in 1990 and i found the movie quite enjoyable to watch. however, they proceeded to make tremors ii and iii. trust me, those movies started going downhill right after they finished the first one, i mean, ass blasters??? now, only god himself is capable of answering the question ""why in gods name would they create another one of these dumpster dives of a movie?"" tremors iv cannot be considered a bad movie, in fact it cannot be even considered an epitome of a bad movie, for it lives up to more than that. as i attempted to sit though it, i noticed that my eyes started to bleed, and i hoped profusely that the little girl from the ring would crawl through the tv and kill me. did they really think that dressing the people who had stared in the other movies up as though they we're from the wild west would make the movie (with the exact same occurrences) any better? honestly, i would never suggest buying this movie, i mean, there are cheaper ways to find things that burn well."	1
just a few words.... this movie really sucks. it's like those tv movies with bad cast and plot. it's amazing how they could make this sequel worse than the iii. don't waste your time watching this crap, even if you like the tremors movies.	1
this, the direct-to-video death rattle of the tremors series, features sixty inspired seconds (sawblade: you'll know it when you see it) and more tedium and filler than you can shake a stick at. tremors 4 was obviously shot on a cripplingly low budget. that means they only had enough special effects mojo for three or four minutes of precious worm-on-human violence, tops. the lackluster, cliche-spouting cast and hackneyed writing ensure that the remaining hour and a half of the tremors 4 experience feels at least fifteen thousand years long. only hardcore tremors fans will be able to sit through, much less enjoy this film. if you aren't among them- don't bother.	1
"the fourth ""tremors"" feature goes back in time, to the year 1889. ""the legend begins"" in the small city of ""perfection"", which was then ""rejection, nevada"". as the story begins, seventeen miners are killed by the ghastly ""graboids"". some of the characters in the present-day ""tremors"" films have ancestors, both figurative and literal, in the past. most obvious is the ever-returning michael gross (as hiram gummer). unlike his descendant, mr. gross is inept with firearms; so, he hires gunslinger billy drago (as ""black hand"" kelly) to shoot 'em up some ""dirt dragons"".<br /><br />this one takes some getting used to - as it takes place in the distant past. it's like a western with miniature versions of the original film's monster ""graboids"". these tamer ""dirt dragons"" are nowhere near as terrorizing as their ""tremors"" (1990) counterparts. consequently, in this film, the characters spend an awful lot of time on the ground, which would not have happened in the original movie. and, it was weird to have the citizens give up the fight so quickly, when gross temporarily decides to leave town. why so helpless? why didn't brent roam (as juan pedilla) immediately rally the people to fight without gross? disappointing.<br /><br />**** tremors 4: the legend begins (2004) s.s. wilson ~ michael gross, brent roam, billy drago"	1
"warning: this review contains minor spoilers.<br /><br />well the writers of the first tremors are officially out of ideas. i'm a big fan of the first movie and the first two sequels are pretty good for straight to video fare. tremors 4: the legends begins, however, is a very dull movie. where the heck are the graboids??? <br /><br />due to the relative lack of graboids through the first 90 minutes i'm convinced that this entry into the series is suppose to be a ""character study"". unfortunately there isn't one interesting character in the movie except for billy drago's character who is given too few lines, too little to do and in the end too little screen time. what saved the 2nd and 3rd movies was the presence of michael gross as burt gummer. whenever there wasn't any action on the screen you could rest assured that burt gummer was going to be interesting to listen too and/or watch. however in this movie gross plays hiram gummer a very poor and boring substitute. <br /><br />on the plus side when the graboids (dirt dragons in this movie) are on the screen they do look good but that is about as good as it gets.<br /><br />i was impressed when i saw that tremors 4 was listed at 101 minutes long. pretty good for straight to video. but after watching it i'm sure that this movie is a good 15 minutes too long. there are long stretches of dialogue that is boring and doesn't further the plot any. was there a rush to get this movie made? i think not, more time could have and should have been spent on the script.<br /><br />i thought i had hit a gold mine when i saw tremors 4 packaged for sale with....tremors!!! what luck i thought, pay for #4 get #1 for free. well after watching tremors 4 i like to think i paid for the original and got this mess for free, i can't imagine paying a single dime for tremors 4. for fans of the series it's best to forget that tremors 4: the legend begins even exists.<br /><br />tremors 4: the legend begins rates a 3 out of 10."	1
"i found tremors 4:the legend begins, to be dull and boring.all the action scenes were stupid.the so called ""graboids"" are reduced to the size of a modern day house cat, if not smaller.the acting was horrendous, and this film was just an unnecessary movie in the tremor saga, because even though it tells the story of how the graboids were formed, the story is so dumb and useless.also, if you want to tell a story way back in time, make sure you use the same actor(michael gross), to be someone in the past, when he's someone in the present in the other tremor movies.geez...if you haven't seen this film, don't waste your time.stick to tremors, 1, 2, and 3, for a good time.this film however, make sure you're remote is sitting right next to you with the stop button working for a quick retreat away from this nonsense."	1
"if fassbinder has made a worse film, i sure don't want to see it! anyone who complains that his films are too talky and claustrophobic should be forced to view this, to learn to appreciate the more spare style he opted for in excellent films like ""the bitter tears of petra von kant"". this film bogs down with so much arty, quasi-symbolic images it looks like a parody of an ""art-film"". the scene in the slaughterhouse and the scene where elvira's prostitute friend channel-surfs for what seems like ten minutes are just two of the most glaring examples of what makes this film a real test of the viewer's endurance. but what really angers me about it are the few scenes which feature just elvira and her ex-wife and/or her daughter. these are the only moments that display any real human emotion, and prove that at the core of this horrible film, there was an excellent film struggling to free itself. what a waste."	1
as if the storyline wasn't depressing enough, this movie shows cows being butchered graphically in a slaughterhouse for all of five minutes while the protagonist is narrating her early life as a butcher. weird stuff. then there's the core premise of the hero/heroine who goes and cuts his dick off because a he's besot-ten with at work says he would have gone with him if he was a girl. is this person a psycho, a masochist, just a doomed queen who takes things too far? and what sort of traumatic childhood did he have? just that he didn't get adopted and had to live it out with nuns who at first loved him and then later hated him because he was unruly. he tries to explain to us the reasons he did what he did, but it's really really so hard to empathize. such sad and unusual self destruction. was it supposed to be funny? what was it all about really?	1
"i can't believe this movie managed to get such a relatively high rating of 6! it is barely watchable and unbelievably boring, certainly one of the worst films i have seen in a long, long time.<br /><br />in a no-budget way, it reminded me of star wars episodes i and ii for the sheer impression that you are watching a total creative train wreck.<br /><br />this film should be avoided at all costs. it's one of those ""festival films"" that only please the pseudo-intellectuals because they are so badly made those people think it makes it ""different"", therefore good.<br /><br />bad film-making is not ""different"", it's just bad film-making."	1
"this is a confused and incoherent mess of interminable scenes of boring dialogues and monologues. that is no exaggeration: you have to make a tremendous effort to even try to become involved with it.<br /><br />i sincerely thought fassbinder would make something interesting in order to tell why does erwin/elvira suicides at the end, but instead of this, in every scene somebody is trying to explain: ""when he was young, this happened..."" and ""he just came back from casablanca and ordered to cut everything down there..."", etc.<br /><br />soon in the movie, erwin/elvira is in a slaughter house talking with a friend prostitute (certainly a slaughter house is the best place for a pleasant little chat), and while telling her the story of elvira's life, fassbinder shows the killing of one cow after the other. it is difficult to choose between giving attention to the disturbing images or what the transvestite is saying. of course we come to the very forced and coarse symbolism of ""i have suffered much in my life, and am about to die"".<br /><br />in one of the sparse moments where actually happens something, erwin/elvira encounters a former lover, that only after performing a extremely gay choreography with two other guys (as if going for the necessary level of homosexuality) is that he recognizes elvira.<br /><br />there are some interesting shots and ideas, i must admit (such as when the nun tells the story of the young erwin), but everything on the movie is wasted due to fassbinder's self- indulgence."	1
"it's funny. i've seen a bunch of fassbinder films and i have found some to be extremely creative and interesting, while others are repellent and self-indulgent messes--like this film. for me, it ranges from great to crap--without much in the middle. i know he has a lot of fans among the ""sophisticated"", but i can't help but think that a lot of his appeal is pure hype. from my point of view (and i know i will get a lot of negative ratings for this), he made too many movies too quickly and was too self-indulgent. his gay or gender-bending films (like this one) tend to be really bad--sloppily done, sometimes quite boring (such as querelle and the bitter tears of petra von kant) and sometimes just gross (like this film). couldn't his message about acceptance of a person's gender-confusion be handled better than showing him get slapped around or watching cows being gruesomely slaughtered? show some sensitivity for the subject matter and make your characters more human and sympathetic--then, maybe, i'd care about the films. <br /><br />i'm honestly at the point after watching this film that i might not bother with any more fassbinder films--the bad seems to be out-weighing the good."	1
this film is in the mandingo & drum type<br /><br />they were both dreadful but they are 100% better than this tripe,<br /><br />badly acted & made oliver reed is the main name & eartha kitt also is in it. tis a pity. rating is 1/2* about as low as yu can get<br /><br />as always<br /><br />jay harris	1
"this is an extremely silly and little seen film about slavery in the west indies and it stars puddy from the ""seinfeld"" show! patrick warburton made his film debut in this contrived movie and he's noticeably slimmer here. oliver reed got top billing but he's hardly in the film at all. warburton plays a white slave and its funny to see all the young and horny wives of rich old men bidding on him because they all want to have sex with him. eartha kitt plays an owner of a bordello and they're is so much nudity in the film. if its not drunken orgies at the bordello then its the young wives having they're turn with him. then of course towards the end the slaves revolt and there's the bloody standoff. no real political message like the film ""burn"" but just another contrived plot device to move the story along. incredibly they made a sequel and warburton and all the rest of the cast came back! i hope they got paid a lot of dough because this first film is pretty bad. the nudity keeps it watchable and warburton's lack of any accent make it at times laughable. very bad film but i got to admit that i want to see the sequel."	1
2 stars out of a possible 10 - and that is being overly generous.<br /><br />i thought with a cast of james woods, cathy bates, randy quaid, lou gossett, jr., and henry thomas - how could it miss. i was wrong.<br /><br />i can only wonder what drugs sam shepard was on the week-end he cranked out this piece of dribble. i'd long suspected sam s. of being kind of nuts, this film, based on his play, confirms it.<br /><br />this is the kind of artsy b.s. that actors love to sink their teeth into as it gives them a chance to endlessly emote. however, for the viewer who sits through this nonsensical trash, there is absolutely nothing to love about this movie.<br /><br />you haven't seen dysfunctional families until you've seen this bunch. pa is crazy, ma is crazy, the son is crazy and the daughter is, oh yeah, crazy. they also have mouths on them that utter words that would make a sailor blush, especially the teenage daughter.<br /><br />in addition to the above, as if that weren't enough, the plot--and it's so thin you could read thorough it--has a hole in it the size of alaska.<br /><br />ma is conspiring to sell their rundown farm. as it turns out so is pa. now i don't claim to be a real estate expert, but the last time i checked, property jointly owned must have both of the owners signatures in order to be sold. if only one of them owned the property, then the other could not legally sell it, so it would be pointless for that person to do so. mr. shepherd prefers to ignore this basic fact, and therefore, his plot does not work.<br /><br />not that anything else was really working anyway.<br /><br />the only possible reason anyone could have for watching this film is if they are absolutely desperate to see james woods in full frontal nudity, and i can't imagine why anyone would want to.	1
"before seeing this movie, i would've said that i loved everything kathy bates has done. now it's everything-minus-one. james woods is pathetic...not his character, his acting. someone should've told him that ""poor"" is not synonymous with dirty, nor ignorant, nor cliche. ditto for randy quaid's stereotyping. the only redeeming feature is henry thomas, who isn't a strong enough actor to carry this sodden mess. if you enjoy the country, you'll enjoy the scenery. that's the best i can give it.<br /><br />i'm a serious fan of both independent and quirky films, but this is simply terrible."	1
"this would've been a *great* silent film. the acting really is good, at least in a look ma, i'm doing really big acting! sort of way.<br /><br />everything is huge. every line is profound! every scene is shattered by human tragedy!<br /><br />mostly, i felt like gagging. yet, like any train wreck, i couldn't tear my eyes away. this dialogue might've worked on the stage, although i doubt it. on the screen, it was cluttered, haphazard, hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic work.<br /><br />if you enjoy your melodrama in huge, heaping doses, you *might* enjoy the movie. be prepared to wait, however. for all that melodrama, this thing sure plods along at its own pace.<br /><br />this script must've sounded a lot different when the actors involved were reading it to themselves. it simply doesn't work once they get around to delivering it in front of the camera.<br /><br />imdb does us a great disservice, at times, when it uses its goofy computer-controlled ""weighted score"". curse of the starving class deserves less than a 1.<br /><br />character-driven fiction is great, but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution, it isn't character development! your characters must have a motivation. being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is *not* character development. that's a plot contrivance.<br /><br />stay away from this movie. or at the very least, watch it muted. perhaps you'll get some amusement from all the arm-waving the characters do.<br /><br />oh, and word to the wise -- to prove that this is truly an artsy film, you see james woods in all his dangly male ""look-at-me, i'm-the-figurative-and-literal-representation-of-the-naked-vulnerability-of- man"" glory.<br /><br />don't say you weren't warned."	1
"this is not a children's movie!!!<br /><br />this movie is like a ""bad acid trip"" for kids under the age of 5. for a month my 4 year old from time-to-time would ask me ""why was that rabbit bleeding from its mouth"" or ""why did the bulldozer bury all the rabbits?"". (and that wasn't the worst of it). we stopped it about a 1/2 hour in but the damage had been done. intensely morbid, oppressive, violent. fortunately he's finally forgotten about the whole wretched thing. whomever decided this movie should be marketed to children should be brought up on charges. ... (go ahead censure me, my conscience is clear.)."	1
"probable reasons why so many people on this site have enjoyed this:<br /><br />1. they might not have read the book. 2. they might enjoy gore and violence in a film. 3. they might be very young and therefore not understand the violence. 4. people might not understand how somehow more scary and more violent it is compared to the original book. 5. there are sure to be many other reasons not covered here.<br /><br />the only thing i liked about this film is the song ""'bright eyes"".<br /><br />if perchance, you happen to be one of those people who has read the book, enjoys calm and peaceful films without violence and are quite old and understand scariness and violence, you are sure not to like this. otherwise you will almost definitely enjoy this.<br /><br />like in the book, a rabbit called fiver in an unsuspecting warren warns of terrible danger to come. only a few rabbits - including his brother hazel - believe him and they set out on a dangerous journey to find a new place to live..."	1
"how many more of those fake ""slice of life"" movies need to be made? hopefully not too many.<br /><br />raising victor vargas is a very self-conscious attempt by the director peter solett at garnering the attention of hollywood. nothing wrong with that in general. what is wrong with this film in particular is that it ignores the audience and piles on every cliché in the book of supposedly ""edgy"" hollywood independent production.<br /><br />it's supposed to be ""real"" so left shake the camera ""documentary style"", except no documentarian would shake the camera on purpose...<br /><br />it's ""edgy"" so let's not waste any time lighting the film.<br /><br />it's ""hip"", so let's have the children use swear words like al pacino in scarface...<br /><br />and so on, and so forth. all that you are left with is a very self-conscious attempt at impressing hollywood that won't impress anyone outside of the ""rarefied"" indie crowd that seems to still heap acclaim on every bad film."	1
"ok, i know that a lot of people will probably resent this review as watership down is a ""classic"" and a standard part of most people's childhood, but seeing this film for the first time at the tender age of 18, i must admit: i really hated it.<br /><br />we watched this film because my sister had read the book and really enjoyed it, and many people who whimpered at the very words ""watership down""- their memories of seeing the film as children and having their emotions torn at the seams- recommended it. to be honest, i wish i hadn't bothered. i gave it the benefit of the doubt; generally i don't like to stop watching a film half way through. this was an exception. it was really, really, excruciatingly, sickeningly dull. this film was possibly the slowest thing i've ever watched (imagine a doped-up snail in space), and really didn't ""do it"" for me. the art was alright; the backgrounds were nicely made if not a little bland and twee, yet the rabbits themselves were not very endearing and the animation was quite jumpy and poorly produced.<br /><br />i'm not going to go into huge details about the storyline; basically it is the tale of a group of rabbits who leave their warren due to the infiltration of humans in the area. generally a moralistic story about the perils of human interactions on the environment, it uses anthropomorphic rabbits to put the message across. for me, i kind of wished that they would get gassed, not because i'm a horrible sadistic person, but because the characters were uninspiring, annoying, dull and generally quite rude (oh i'm so terribly english). i found that i was constantly looking at the clock whilst watching the film, and it took a whole 20 minutes or so before anything actually happened, and even that was a terrible anticlimax.<br /><br />if i were to praise it in any way, i'd have to admit that the concept of showing children the perils of building on the countryside and hopefully unveiling the arrogance of humans etc etc is quite well-meaning. maybe it is all in general sanctimonious and preachy, but the message it's trying to put forth is good in its nature. the musical score was not bad, too.<br /><br />so, to conclude, this film is pretty poor. i couldn't watch it the whole way through, or i'd probably be forced to eat my own legs in sheer boredom. granted, it isn't ""torque"" bad, but it still doesn't rate highly in my eyes, so i've given it a 2/10.<br /><br />hope this helps."	1
i saw this movie as a very young girl (i'm 27 now) and it scared me witless for years. i had nightmares about every aspect of this film from the way it was drawn to the music to (obviously) the violence. my parents still argue about who allowed me to watch it and both of them say that they would never let me watch such a movie. i think they only say that knowing that i have such strong feelings about it ;0) i am currently reading the book (out of morbid curiosity and the fact that it's a classic) and it is really a great story. however i don't think that it should have been made into a cartoon. ever. well, maybe kids nowadays would find it quaint but it gave me nightmares for weeks and weeks and i still have a hard time seeing rabbits drawn in a similar way. gives me a little heart palpitation every time. yah i am a wuss but i strongly suggest that any parent looking to show this movie to their kids, read them the book instead or watch it first to make certain that they approve of the content. not everyone finds it as disturbing as i did but we are out there ;0)	1
firstly, i am not easily scared by... anything except for my few phobias, but this movie is absolutely horrific. this is not appropriate for children at all! i had my mouth open the whole time it just shocked me i. couldn't believe how gory it was for a children's movie, bunnies being brutally murdered! it's just unnecessary to be so horrifying and be rated g. i recommend being over 8 to see this. but don't get me wrong, it was probably a good movie if i wasn't scarred mentally as a child. i cannot believe a parent would allow a, let's say, 4 year old child to watch this. it's just to intense and complicated, not to forget gory, for young kids. i'm wayy over 4 and i was shocked by the violence. i don't recommend	1
so... it's really sexist, and classist, and i thought that it might not be in the beginning stages of the movie, like when stella tells steven that she would really like to change herself and begin speaking in the right way and he tells her not to change. well, he certainly changed his tune, and it seems that the other reviewers followed suit. what at the beginning appears to be a love story is really about social placement and women as sacrificial mothers. the end of the movie does not make her a hero, it makes the whole thing sad. and its sad that people think it makes her a hero. perhaps that is the comment of the movie that people should take away. positive reception reflects continual patriarchal currents in the social conscience. yuck.	1
i should love this movie . the acting is very good and barbara stanwyck is great but the the movie has always seemed very trite to me . the movie makes working class people look low and cheap .the fact that the daughter is ashamed of her mother and that the daughter does not rise above it has always made me a bit uneasy . barbara stanwyck as the mother worships the daughter but the daughter forgoes a mothers love to find happiness with her well to do fathers family . i wonder how many others who have seen this film feel this way about it.again the acting was very very good and worth watching . i really don't like the story line . just a personal preference .thank you	1
"this movie is great, mind you - but only in the way it tells a very bad story. stella is so terribly crude, and never learns better. her husband is incredibly snobby and small-minded. neither ever learns better. is this realistic? somehow, stella understands that her daughter is ashamed of her gaudy manners & dress, yet cannot understand that she just needs to tone it all down? i don't think so. stella is a good woman, and a very good mother. giving up herself, so her daughter can be associated with a bunch of bigoted snobs is disgusting. <br /><br />much of what we see might have been normal for the times - people having a beer or two, enjoying a player piano, dancing - but it is made out to be some sort of moral inferiority. ""i can't have our child living this way!"" spare me. <br /><br />this story tells me one thing: that the unwashed working class cannot ever hope to aspire to the heights of the upper classes. and that is simply a load of hogwash."	1
i hate this movie. it is a horrid movie. sean young's character is completely unsympathetic. her performance is wooden at best. the storyline is completely predictable, and completely uninteresting. i would never recommend this film to anyone. it is one of the worst movies i have ever had the misfortune to see.	1
"well, they say nymphomania leaves you unsatisfied. i don't know if stella james (sean young) qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac, but she certainly is in to sexual relations with men. she's still exploring, trying to find ""more data"" so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it, though it seems like at her age she should have a pretty good idea by now. (i can't agree, however, with anyone who says young is too old for the role. if she is, we should all age so nicely.) for the most part this film left me cold, though it's by no means the worst of its type you'll ever see. and unlike the recent 'eyes wide shut,' at least something happens in this one."	1
"did anyone else feel as betrayed as i did? the first hour or so was pretty solid but the last. oh my god. it seemed like it was predictable and cheesy. not grandiose and epic like the entire run of the show has been. most reviews have read have been glowing but i really can't understand why. i had seriously predicted that general ending way earlier on but then retracted it because i thought ""no, they would never do that, that's far too lame."" i can hardly stand it. i feel so unsatisfied. i think i'm about to walk out the door to go sell every season i own. someone please. change my mind. i want to love this. so bad. someone tell me why i'm wrong. great show. terrible ending."	1
the first half was ok, but the last half really, really disappointed. it's funny the producers even admitted they didn't have a clue for the ending, and it really showed. whats really sad is i have to write ten lines of comment minimum to be able to post this. i really didn't want to include spoilers to qualify my remarks since the show isn't really worth that effort. when battlestar galatica first came out i was really excited with the prospect of a better remake, it didn't happen that first season border on being space porn. they eventually cleaned it up a bit and actually had some pretty fair drama, so i started watching again. but to end the series with kara being a cyclon god angel, same with baltar and six was pretty dumb.	1
"first of all, write the script on a napkin. who needs more than that? after all we're not a hollywood film.<br /><br />then get amateur actors. it will be good for the festival hype. after all, who needs people who have spent years honing their craft? then, hire a cinematographer who doesn't know how to light. you see, if it's well-lit, it won't look ""real"" and the festival people won't like it. who needs to have professional level photography anyway? then hire a ten-year old who has never held a camera to be your operator. it will give your movie that completely amateurish touch that festival screeners will mistake for ""reality"" and guarantee that even though you will empty the seats from real people, critics and a small sliver of the audience who over-intellectualize will scream ""genius"" because they won't believe this was just complete amateur-hour.<br /><br />once you've done that, buy your ticket to the festival of bad movies aka sundance.<br /><br />what a sad waste."	1
"there are many good things about the new bsg: there's the multiple cylon roles for model 8 and 6, for example, which the two actresses played superbly. there's the old school feel of industrial design aboard galactica (""my ship will not be networked, over my dead body!"") also, all the space battles, the special effects (even though the seasoned sci-fi watcher will acknowledge the cartoonishness of it all) the darkness of the characters, their essentially flawed nature.<br /><br />that makes it all the more bitter that the ending was so childish.<br /><br />yes, the first part, the scenes in space, the raid on the cylons and all that was very good. but the mushy ending? i always watch films and shows these days with the timer hidden, so i never know how much time is left until the end. so for me it was a special kind of torture, to see the end happen over and over again. every time i thought, oh this is the final scene, the final shot, i got one more. every frakking character got its complete ending! that wasn't really necessary.<br /><br />what really highlighted the schoolboy amateurishness of it all: the young roslin scenes. why is important for us to know that: {a} she lost her sisters and father in a horrible accident and {b} that she has a one night stand with a former pupil/student? what does that bring to the story? where was the linkage? now, i'm all for a more european-ish style approach, and a random acts of whateverness in films and shows, and all that, but this was just ridiculous. this didn't bring anything meaningful to the story.<br /><br />also, i've seen the ""last frakkin special"" and in it ron revealed his own cluelessness about the plot: he couldn't come up with a good ending for the story, so .... he just didn't! it's never as much about the characters as they made the last episode to be. the whole ""this was thousands of years in the past"" idea, the mitochondrial eve thing, was also used in the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy, and believe you me, there are a lot of bsg watchers who know that particular h2g2 storyline. and speaking of hera, now there's a storyline that was not worked out well, at all. instead we get roslin is doing her former pupil who's 20 years younger. don't get me wrong, i'm all for older women with younger men. the more power to them. but this ... just made no sense.<br /><br />all in all, (the writing in) this series is as flawed as they intended its characters would be. that goes even moreso for the last episode. i hope lost and 24 do better, with their series finales."	1
"horrible ending - and i can't believe moore spent a year coming up with it. smacks of l. ron hubbard and dianetitcs, which hubbard claimed to pen in just three weeks. this was actually disappointing enough for me to toss my discs from the first 3.5 years. now, the first 1.5 hours were action packed, though absurd in the premise, and then it deteriorated into a slow, painful, sophomoric dissolution of the series. unbelievable how slow and drawn out that last hour was. were we to think more deeply? if i wanted a lesson in a-materialism, i would reread daniel quinn's ishmael. absurd to think 38k people would give up everything for a ""fresh start"". absurd to throw in a disappearing kara, and a reappearing baltar and six. absurd to throw in the mitochondrial eve. just absurd."	1
the fight scenes were great. loved the old and newer cylons and how they painted the ones on their side. it was the ending that i hated. i was disappointed that it was earth but 150k years back. but to travel all that way just to start over? are you kidding me? 38k people that fought for their very existence and once they get to paradise, they abandon technology? no way. sure they were eating paper and rationing food, but that is over. they can live like humans again. they only have one good doctor. what are they going to do when someone has a tooth ache never mind giving birth... yea right. no one would have made that choice.	1
"did i step in something or is that bad smell coming from daybreak 1 + 2? god was behind everything? what has god got to do with sci-fi? god is only the answer when you can't think up a sensible explanation for something. in fact, this is exactly the problem with the series finale - they obviously couldn't think up sensible explanations for the multitude of big questions that were raised throughout the series such as how kara thrace come back from the dead in a brand new viper, how her old viper and charred body ended up on earth 2, why baltar has an imaginary 6 in his head, why 6 has an imaginary baltar in her head, etc. so they explain it with ""angels"" or just don't explain it at all.<br /><br />the plot of the last 2 episodes had holes big enough to fly a basestar through. for example, why does galactica and its crew go on a suicide mission to rescue one girl (hera), particularly after adama said there was no way he'd attempt a rescue? because they found out the location of the cylon base? that's not a good reason to sacrifice the crew's lives. and how did anders know the location? and what was the point of the flashbacks to the major characters' lives before the war? it's like they forgot to do it earlier so they threw something in at the last moment.<br /><br />the people who wrote the last two episodes could not have been the same writers who created what has been so far a sensational series. feels like the script writing was take over by evangelical christians on a mission to spread 'the word'. forget trying to tie up the loose ends in the plot, the important message the writers wanted to get across is: don't put your faith in technology as it will lead to your destruction; god is your ultimate salvation (tough luck if you have an illness that needs medical treatment).<br /><br />imagine in the final movie of the star wars series they tell you there is no ""force""... instead, a jedi actually gets his power from jesus. then they fly their spaceships into the nearest star and go live in the forest with the ewoks. would this be a good ending? no it frakken' wouldn't."	1
with these people faking so many shots, using old footage, and gassing animals to get them out, not to mention that some of the scenes were filmed on a created set with actors, what's to believe? old film of countries is nice, but the animal abuse and degradation of natives is painful to watch in these films. i know, racism is ok in these old films, but there is more to that to make this couple lose credibility. portrayed as fliers, they never flew their planes, martin johnson was an ex-vaudevillian, used friends like jack london for financial gain while stiffing them of royalties, denying his wife's apparent depression, using her as a cute prop, all this makes these films unbearable. they were by no means the first to travel to these lands, or the first to write about them. he was ok as a filmmaker and photographer, but that's about it.	1
"the 1930s saw a vogue for documentary films about remote corners of the world, with an emphasis on wild animals, exotic terrain and primitive people with unusual cultures. despite the logistics of transporting a film crew to a distant and dangerous place, and then bringing 'em back alive (with the film footage), such films were often much cheaper to make than were conventional hollywood features ... because there were no expensive sets, costumes, or high-priced movie stars.<br /><br />the most successful makers of such films (artistically and financially) were the team of martin e. johnson and his wife osa, who made several documentaries (sometimes with blatantly staged events) in africa and asia. the johnsons' safari films were extremely popular, inspiring several parodies ... most notably wheeler & woolsey's ""so this is africa"", in which the very sexy esther muir plays a character named mrs. johnson-martini (instead of martin e. johnson, geddit?). although several other filmmakers were producing safari documentaries at this time, the johnsons' films were the most popular in this genre because they relied heavily on humour. viewed from our own more enlightened (i hope) standpoint, this is a serious flaw in the johnsons' documentaries: there are too many scenes in which the funny little brown or yellow people are made to look complete idiots who are easily outsmarted by the clever white bwana johnson and his wife.<br /><br />one definite asset of these movies is the presence of osa johnson. ten years younger than her husband, she manages to seem young enough to be his daughter. while certainly not as attractive as the shapely blond esther muir, osa johnson was a pert brunette who gave ingratiating performances in front of the camera in all the films she co-produced with her husband.<br /><br />'congorilla' is probably the best of the johnsons' films. the shots of the congo are interesting and have some historical value as evidence of what this environment looked like in 1930. the shots of the pygmies and other natives are also interesting, although these suffer from the johnsons' penchant to stage events in a manner that makes the natives look 'wild' and alien.<br /><br />the best (and funniest) scene in 'congorilla' is an improvised sequence in which osa johnson attempts to teach a jazz dance to some pygmy women. (the dance is the black bottom, no less ... the same dance which bob hope famously taught to daisy and violet hilton, the conjoined twins.) wearing jodhpurs, riding boots, and a pith helmet, osa johnson starts scat-singing while she does high steps and slaps her knees in her attempt to teach this dance to the african women. meanwhile, they just stand there staring at her, apparently wondering what this crazy white woman is trying to accomplish. it's a very funny scene, but it has unpleasant undertones. osa johnson is doing a dance that was invented by black americans: the implication seems to be that black africans should instinctively be able to perform this dance after a brief demonstration (using natural rhythm, i guess) because it's in their blood, or something.<br /><br />i'll rate 'congorilla' 4 points out of 10. this film says a little bit about african life in the 1930s and rather more about american cultural perceptions in that same decade."	1
"admirably odd, though mean-spirited comedy-drama about a strange young man who hopes to fly like a bird through the houston astrodome. robert altman-directed quasi-comedy with eccentric characters is so overloaded with weirdos that it starts to creak early on from the weight. some of the cinematography is evocative, shelley duvall is a stitch in her debut as a tour guide, and sally kellerman looks every inch the glamourpuss as bud cort's vision of a ""mother bird"" (imagine altman and producer lou adler explaining that role to her!). in the lead, bud cort is--once again, after ""harold & maude""--a true original; not off-putting like, say, michael j. pollard, cort manages to be geeky, wacky and inoffensive, a tough act to pull off. unfortunately, this is one of altman's misfires. he can put together a cast and a showpiece like no one else, but let him get fired up with some misguided inspiration and he spirals downward. ** from ****"	1
the movie sucked, it wasn't funny, it wasn't exciting. they tried to make it so bad that it would be good, but failed. and thinking it's cool to like this movie, next to the hype, are the only reasons that this movie is a success...<br /><br />the fact that at this moment 50% voted a 10 out of 10 for this movie seems pretty concerning to me, either the movie going public is going insane or this vote is unrealistic which can have numerous causes, and should be dealt with. anyway it is a less than average movie which bloomed through mouth to mouth advertising. it's success can only be described as a marketing marvel.	1
i'd like to think myself as a fairly open minded guy and it takes a lot(!) for me to dislike a movie but this one is without a doubt one of the suckiest, crappiest movie i've ever seen!<br /><br />i have no idea what's wrong with the people who gave it such a good rating here (imdb is usually pretty reliable when it comes to ratings)... the only thing i can imagine is that people must've voted during one or more conditions:<br /><br />1. while being shitfaced / stoned out of their minds 2. they've received hard cash for the votes 3. under gunpoint<br /><br />i can't believe i wasted a good 1 h 45 min of my life for this pathetic excuse for a movie.	1
what a bad, bad film!!! i can't believe all the hype that has been lavished on this pretentious, amateurish excuse for a real movie!! i left the theater before the end, stunned by how bad the direction and camera-work of that movie were!! and to read adoring paeans that claim there is truth and reality in this film when all it is in reality is a brazen attempt at pulling the wool over the eyes of reviewers and festivals by being cheap and tawdry.<br /><br />at least this film showed me once and for all that the sundance festival has become a complete joke and that being shown here is more a label of bad film-making than anything else.<br /><br />avoid at all costs. you'll want your time back! i know i did.	1
"unless you are between the ages of 10 and 14 (except for the r rating), there are very few things to like here. one or two lines from kenan thompson, david koechner (we really should see him more) and sam jackson are humorous and julianna margulies is as good as she can be considering her surroundings, but sadly, that's it. poor plot. poor acting. worse writing and delivery. the special effects are dismal. as much as the entire situation is an odd and awful joke, the significant individual embedded situations are all equally terrible. if we consider the action portions, well there are unbelievable action sequences in some films that make you giddy and there are some that make you groan. this movie only contains the latter kind. this leaves little left. i'm so glad i did not pay for this.<br /><br />despite any hype, i can read and think, so as i sat down to watch, i did not expect anything good. i had no expectations, but was somewhat worried going in. yet, like a train wreck, one cannot merely look away. and even with no expectations, i was let down. bad. not even 'so bad, it's good' material. i'm _very_ tolerant of bad movies, but this makes ""six string samurai"" (which i liked) oscar worthy.<br /><br />no, this piece of over cgi'd rubbish is in the same company as battlefield earth, little man and gigli. how this is currently rated a 7.2 completely mystifies me. brainwashing or somehow stacking the voting system is all that i can think of as answers.<br /><br />i could go on and on but suffice to say that tonight, i witnessed a train wreck. i need to go wash my eyes. 1 of 10"	1
"i stopped watching this pos as soon as the snakes started ""taking over"" the plane.<br /><br />at first i thought maybe it should get a ""one"" for the comic relief. but then i realized i could just watch the three stooges for free and laugh more! <br /><br />whatever respect i might have had for samuel jackson has been irreversibly destroyed. and hollywood demonstrates once again how removed from reality they really are. when i was a kid we used to catch snakes for fun. the only thing snakes would do is huddle at the bottom of the cargo bay. and no amount of hollywood cartoon snakes can change that.<br /><br />this movie isn't worth a trip to blockbuster. be warned: if you pay for it, the only ""victim"" is your dumb ass.<br /><br />if you want to be really scared, i suggest the descent. if you want humor, go to your local stand up comedy club. their worst performer will be a million times better than this trash."	1
all internet buzz aside, this movie was god awful. i expected the movie to be more of a farce than anything. instead the film makers tried to make a serious thriller/horror movie, and they completely missed. there were only a few good parts, and a couple good lines by samuel jackson. other than that, it was a bunch of gore and some poorly animated snakes. all of the internet joking was miles better than the actual movie. now that the movie has actually come out, hopefully this joke will die. don't waste your time or money on this piece of over hyped trash. if you're looking for something that's funny and entertaining, then just go to snakes on a blog.	1
i saw an early screening of this film in new york and i, along with my friends and pretty much the entire audience, were vastly disappointed. the movie wasn't even so bad it was good; it was as lifeless as a snake-bite victim. samual l. jackson looked surprisingly tired through most of it and the snake effects were lame. it reminded me of one of those cheesy scifi movies, except the cheesiness of this movie was not funny or even campy. it all seemed worn, flat, and overtly formulaic. i'm shocked to say i actually think anaconda was more fun. it's easy to understand that soap realizes it's a piece of s*it and plays along with it, but what the film fails to embark on is a script that has any scares of suspense. it's the worst kind of lame movie: it's joyless.	1
"the only thing great about the movie is its title. in this case, ""snake on a plane"" is example of not judging the book by its cover, the title says nothing about the movie. when i went to the theater, i wasn't expecting citizen kane, i was expecting independence day, a movie that's pure popcorn fun, but instead, i got that horrible roy liotta movie called "" turbulence"" yes, this is how bad soap is. the only thing make soap better is its title. and it's not even the apporiate title for the movie, the wasn't even a glimpse of ""snake"" or ""plane"" 40 minutes into the movie! what a false advertising! if it wasn't for its title, soap would be just another unforgettable cheap b-grade summer movie. and the r rating? it has to be the most undeserved r rated movie of all time! the makers of the movie only add a few f word to make this a r, all of the violence are kept pg-13 level. you know what's really r rated? the r rated superstar edge! see him at summerslam instead of waste your money on a snake!"	1
this must be one of the worst movies i've ever seen, the graphics are ridiculous, and the script pathetic and the biggest question is how this rather low brow script got trough the selection process.<br /><br />i like all sorts of movies from deep dramas to the more male oriented kill everything you see type of movie, so i can't say i'm picky. i have been struggling to find something to compare it to, but i just can't think of anything that matches this, maybe starship troopers 2. witch in my opinion makes the movie gods cry and me thinking about throwing out my dvd player, but compared to this its effects are great. the acting superb and the script should be awarded. you know when a movie is bad in a funny way, well folks this isn't one of those this kills your soul minute by minute.	1
"b movie at best. sound effects are pretty good. lame concept, decent execution. i suppose it's a rental.<br /><br />""you put some olive oil in your mouth to save you from de poison, den you cut de bite and suck out de poisen. you gonna be ok tommy.""<br /><br />""you stay by the airphone, when agent harris calls you get me!"" ""give me a fire extinguisher.""<br /><br />""weapons - we need weapons. where's the silverware? all we have is this. sporks!?""<br /><br />dr price is the snake expert.<br /><br />local ers can handle the occasional snakebite. alert every er in the tri-city area."	1
"i chose to see this movie because it got a good score here on imdb. but a lot of people either have really poor taste or someone's been fixing the score.<br /><br />either way it was a real disappointment. the movie is exactly as stupid and far fetched as the title would suggest. there really is no reason to give a summary of the plot - but here goes: it felt like someone had been thinking: ""wouldn't it be cool to make a movie where there were snakes on a plane? and then the snakes for some reason would go crazy and start biting and stuff?!?"" and that's about it! the plot is thin and unoriginal. the snakes are bad cgi (but it makes sense to cut corners on a movie that no one in their right mind will recommend to anyone!). the acting is poor, and all people are unbelievable stereo types.<br /><br />to sum it up: it's one of the worst movies i've ever seen - stay away!"	1
oh dear lord, how on earth was any part of this film ever approved by anyone? it reeks of cheese from start to finish, but it's not even good cheese. it's the scummiest, moldiest, most tasteless cheese there is, and i cannot believe there is anyone out there who actually, truly enjoyed it. yes, if you saw it with a load of drunk/stoned buddies then some bits might be funny in a sad kind of way, but for the rest of the audience the only entertaining parts are when said group of buddies are throwing popcorn and abusive insults at each other and the screen. i watched it with an up-for-a-few-laughs guy, having had a few beers in preparation to chuckle away at the film's expected crapness. we got the crapness (plenty of it), but not the chuckles. it doesn't even qualify as a so-bad-it's-good movie. it's just plain bad. very, very bad. here's why (look away if you're spoilerphobic): the movie starts out with a guy beating another guy to death. ok, i was a few minutes late in so not sure why this was, but i think i grasped the 'this guy is a bit of a badass who you don't want to mess with' message behind the ingenious scene. oh, and a guy witnesses it. so, we already have our ultra-evil bad guy, and wussy but cute (apparently) good guy. cue hero. big sam steps on the scene in the usual fashion, saving good guy in the usual inane way that only poor action films can accomplish, i.e. hero is immune to bullets, everyone else falls over rather clumsily. cue first plot hole. how the bloody hell did sammy know where this guy was, or that he'd watched the murder. perhaps this, and the answers to all my plot-hole related questions, was explained in the 2 minutes before i got into the cinema, but i doubt it. in fact, i'm going to stop poking holes in the plot right here, lest i turn the movie into something resembling swiss cheese (which we all know is good cheese). so, the 'plot' (a very generous word to use). good guy must get to la, evil guy would rather he didn't, hero sam stands between the two. cue scenery for the next vomit-inducing hour - the passenger plane. as i said, no more poking at plot holes, i'll just leave it there. passenger plane. next, the vital ingredient up until now missing from this gem of a movie, and what makes it everything it is - snakes. yay! oh, pause. first we have the introduction to all the obligatory characters that a lame movie must have. hot, horny couple (see if you can guess how they die), dead-before-any-snakes-even-appear british guy (those pesky brits, eh?), cute kids, and jo brand. for all you americans that's an english comic famous for her size and unattractiveness. now that we've met the cast, let's watch all of them die (except of course the cute kids). don't expect anything original, it's just snake bites on various and ever-increasingly hilarious (really not) parts of the body. use your imagination, since the film-makers obviously didn't use theirs.<br /><br />so, that's most of the film wrapped up, so now for the best bit, the ending. as expected, everything is just so happy as the plane lands that everyone in sight starts sucking face. yep, ice-cool sammy included. but wait, we're not all off the plane yet! the last guy to get off is good guy, but just as he does he gets bitten by a (you guessed it) snake (of all things). clearly this one had been hiding in mr. jackson's hair the whole time, since it somehow managed to resist the air pressure trick that the good old hero had employed a few minutes earlier, despite the 200ft constrictor (the one that ate that pesky british bugger) being unable to. so, sam shoots him and the snake in one fell swoop. at this point i prayed that the movie was about to make a much-needed u-turn and reveal that all along the hero was actually a traitor of some sort. but no. in a kind of icing on the cake way (but with stale cheese, remember), it is revealed that the climax of the film was involving a bullet proof vest. how anyone can think that an audience 10 years ago, let alone in 2006 would be impressed by their ingenuity is beyond me, but it did well in summing up the film.<br /><br />actually, we're not quite done yet. after everyone has sucked face (uncle sam with leading actress, good guy with tiffany, token black guy with token white girl, and the hot couple in a heart warming bout of necrophilia), it's time for good guy and hero to get it on....in bali!!! nope, it wasn't at all exciting, the exclamation marks were just there to represent my utter joy at seeing the credits roll. yes, the final shot of the film is a celebratory surfing trip to convey the message that a bit of male bonding has occurred, and a chance for any morons that actually enjoyed the movie to whoop a few times. that's it. this is the first time i've ever posted a movie review, but i felt so strongly that somebody must speak out against this scourge of cinematography. if you like planes, snakes, samuel l.jackson, air hostesses, bad guys, surfing, dogs in bags or english people, then please, please don't see this movie. it will pollute your opinion of all of the above so far that you'll never want to come into contact with any of them ever again. go see united 93 instead. that was good.	1
this is not a film you can really analyse separately from it's production. the audience became the film-makers to an extent unprecedented in the history of the american film industry; we felt so involved that viewing it becomes like watching the work of a friend. how is it possible to be objective? this is our movie, isn't it? or is it? there may be nothing more disingenuous than a film-maker who promotes himself as the audience's friend, giving them all the naughty treats that the nannyish critics would deny them. just look at that prime self-publicist eli roth, promising gore-hounds all the viscera missing from literally gutless mainstream horror films, only to churn out a watered down and technically incompetent piece of work like 'hostel'.<br /><br />david r. ellis may not have spawned the monster that was the internet response to his film, but he was, quite understandably, quick to engage with it. he took the carnival-huckster school of film-making to a new level, getting the fans to build what they would eventually buy. so many have enthused over this interactive, democratic approach to film-making that they seem to have missed the point - that this is the most cynical form of film-as-marketing. nothing is included that the film-makers know the fans won't buy, and any old suggestion that will get bums on seats is incorporated. the fact that the pitch became the title tells you all you need to know.<br /><br />isn't this just the evolution of the focus group approach? individual creativity, talent, craft, ideas, all are sacrificed before the inane chatter of the masses. it's a critical commonplace that focus groups and test screenings don't make for good movies - why should the preemptive intervention of internet enthusiasts be any different? because we happen to be film fans? well, thank god for us, because otherwise i might not have seen a topless woman get her nipple bitten by a snake.<br /><br />so, yes, i had fun at the movie - a midnight showing, fresh from the pub and with a bucket of ice-cream - but it actually had relatively little to do with the film, and quite a lot to do with the atmosphere. like christmas, everyone seemed determined that they would have fun, no matter what. there was laughter, but i don't know if it was with the film, or at the film. with a film as calculated as this one, is that even a meaningful distinction? there are some genuinely good aspects to the film. samuel l. jackson gives a well-judged performance, pure self-parody but with a real sense of pleasure. rachel blanchard and lin shaye are decent in limited roles, and there are one or two inspired moments - the fate of the lap dog is genuinely funny black comedy that the rest of the film fails to emulate.<br /><br />the stock characters are to be expected, but the total lack of suspense isn't. what's the point of a film that combines two great phobias if there's no creeping menace? there are several snake-jumps-out moments, but they're incredibly badly staged. only the annoying british man gets a decent pulpy death scene - the other killings are oddly flat. the demise of the honeymoon couple, for instance, is shamefully botched. most of the actors fail to make an impression; it's a shame that a charismatic actress like julianna margulies should seem so tired (when she tells two kids to close their eyes and pretend the turbulent flight is a roller-coaster, she could be talking to the audience - the film falls far short).<br /><br />there are worse movies, but there are many, many better; another reviewer on this site compared this film with 'lake placid', and it's as apt a contrast as any i can think of. that film worked so magnificently because the performances were excellent, the jokes were funny, the suspense sequences were scary, and it wasn't devised by committee. that the characters had a little depth and shading was an unexpected bonus. i don't need a post-pub midnight showing to have a good time with that film.<br /><br />this film will, in time, fade to become a mere footnote in film history. if it sets a precedent, however, i'm genuinely worried about what might be crossing our screens in a couple of years time. in all probability, nothing much will come of it. perennial popcorn favourites - 'raiders of the lost ark', 'alien', 'halloween' and of course, 'star wars' - just aren't produced by group-think.<br /><br />in the mean time, i'll tell you what - i haven't half got a craving for some ingmar bergman.	1
"this movie was the worst movie i have seen since ""date movie."" i was laughing through out the whole movie instead of being scared. it was funny how the snakes would search for particular section of the passengers body to attack for example, the eye, the tongue, the butt, the breast. if we have seen national geographic channel we know snakes wont stay clinched on the body once they bite. for each particular scene the snakes would bite the passengers and would stay on the body biting the person. i believe the producer did not study his information on snakes and their behavior. i cant believe i wasted my money on this movie.so i don't recommend this movie trust just wait until it is at the dollar theatre or rent it."	1
"i am sick and tired of all these little weenies going on about how this movie ""rocked"". it is pure cg over-acted crap! don't send an assassin, it's much more sensible to smuggle hundreds of brightly colored, aggressive, venomous snakes on a plane! the only reason people like this movie because they feel they have to. it is not ""so bad it's good"" it's so bad i'd rather be poked in the eye with a sharp stick then be subjected to this again. i honestly thought was going to be a comedy like airplane! a spoof! was i wrong. it's that whole ""it sucks, get it!"" or samuel a. jackson yells ""snakes on the plane! thing. well i'm sorry, i don't get it. it looks like a bunch of wimps gave the movie industry more money to make more movies like triple x and die hard. if you what spend money to watch a movie in the company of the same people who bought william hung's cd, still live in their mommies basement, and stink of plastic chair sweat from days on the computer playing online games and looking at porn, then rush to the theater and ask for one (since i doubt you have a girlfriend) ticket for snakes on a stupid-butt plane. to hell with movies like full metal jacket, pulp fiction, true romance, 12 monkeys, clerks, etc. there's no irony in watching good movies. the true decline of the western civilization. calling this a cult film is an insult to true cult classics like repo man, or even orgazmo. i've said enough here."	1
"i saw the 10p.m. showing and i must say that this movie was nothing special. although i did not leave the theater wanting my time back (as i don't actually pay for movies anymore) i didn't really find any redeeming qualities.<br /><br />there were a few lines and such that made me chuckle, but mostly the film seemed to consist of rampant fan service to the younger (in mind more than age as this film is rated r) male audience. the fan service seemed out of place and rather distracting as well. i know you all want to hear samuel l. say his infamous line, but let's be honest, it's a whole lot of hype for very little pay off. the only truly horrible part of the film was the cg, which looked very digitized and did not mesh well with the live action on the screen.<br /><br />now i am a reasonable man, i knew going into the theater that i wasn't going to be seeing ""casablanka,"" and i am at least thankful that this film is an original (albiet inane) idea and not some re-make or franchise spin off. however to be honest, if you are not a part of the cult following you are probably better off spending your money elsewhere and seeing the film either in a second run theater in a few weeks or renting it in a few months."	1
"this movie deserves more than a 1. but i'm giving it a one because so many fricken fan boys have given it a 10 resulting in it getting a rating that'll take it into the top 100 list. seriously it's not that great its not that bad. its a stupid cult classic with so many fricken fan boys it's ridiculous. these are the types who probably still laugh at chuck norris jokes and still say ""i'm rick james b!tch"" no matter how old or annoying it gets. i dread having to hear ""i'm tired of mfn snakes on this mfn plane"" months from now from idiots trying to be funny. its crappy plot crap acting etc. its okay to love a bad movie, but you still gotta admit its a bad movie.<br /><br />wait for the marine starring john cena if you wanna see a real movie"	1
when discussing a movie titled 'snakes on a plane', we should point out early that the snakes are pretty darn important to the plot.<br /><br />what we have here are very bad cgi snakes that neither look nor move like real snakes. snakes are scary because they appear to be slimy, they crawl they slither. these snakes do nothing of the sort. they glide along like they would in a video game. they are cartoon snakes. i would go as far to say that even someone that had a major phobia against real snakes would not find these ones scary<br /><br />why on earth then would you want to include extreme close ups of these cgi failures? why not rely on suspense.. the whole 'less is more' ethic. or better still, why not just make them look good in the first place? and then maybe still use them sparingly<br /><br />take one look at john carpenters 'the thing'. here we have real slime, and gore of eerie proportions. 20 years go by and we get this pile of stinking sfx crap 'snakes on a plane'. when are these people going to wake up and smell the coffee? special effects are going backwards!<br /><br />sure you could say.. but the movie is a joke, get it? sure i'm with that idea, but do it well! in addition to the above, this movie has crap dialogue. and the music and sound effects are not creepy or memorable in any way.<br /><br />i could handle every other actor being part of this movie, except for jackson. what was he doing there? the man who starred in pulp fiction 10 years ago. is this career progression? are you offering people value for money? no. i'd like to know what tarantino thought when he was half way through this stinker of a movie<br /><br />the current generation seem to have very low expectations. and hollywood seems to be offering them just what they want. on leaving the cinema i saw a number of advertisements for some truly horrendous looking future releases including... doa: dead or alive, (another) cgi animal film called 'flushed away', and another crap looking comedy named 'click'. in addition to that i saw some awful trailers, including one for (another) crap british horror/comedy. i've truly not seen the movie industry in a mess like this for a long time<br /><br />expect to see this movie for sale in the dvd bargain section for £1 in 6 months time. and if you're expecting to see a black comedy with tonnes of great looking snakes, and some bad ass cool dialogue coming from samuel l jacksons lips. forget it.	1
"$25,000 pyramid clues: deep blue sea. tremors. slither. eight legged freaks.<br /><br />pyramid category: movies that were funnier and more thrilling than snakes on a plane.<br /><br />hell, with that definition i'd have to include the relatively harrowing journey of ted and elaine in airplane! as superior to snakes in both laughs and thrills.<br /><br />the sad truth is that this isn't even close to the mother of all unintentionally intentional funny snake movies: anaconda! besides the never to be seen again casting of jlo-cube-o.wilson-stoltz-wuhrer in the same flick, you had jon voight pulling off the all-time cinematic heist. his final scene alone represents everything soap tried and failed to do as a ""so-ludicrous-it's-fun"" movie.<br /><br />in the end, snakes on a plane is definitive proof that studio execs and fanboys make the worst collaborators possible. every big scene had been discussed and dissected so much the last year, all that was left to amuse by opening night was the amount of fanboy flop-sweat that had to be mopped up at my theater. i heard more forced laughs here than at a studio taping for ""according to jim""."	1
i'd give this a negative rating if i could. i went into this movie not expecting much, but i had an open mind. the whole thing is stupid! the snakes are obviously fake and the first two things they bite are a boob and a guys johnson. oh how original; if i were a 12 year old boy i might laugh at that. i have no idea how this movie became so popular. seriously,the worst thing i've ever seen. i wasn't entertained, it wasn't funny,i wasn't even bored! i wasn't anything. it wasn't even so bad it was good, it's just bad. ridiculous actually. please do not waste your money on this movie. don't even rent this movie. no clue how it's getting such a high rating.	1
"what can i say? i'm a secret fan of 'over the top' action and horror films. especially when it comes with a lot of lots of humour and innuendo, but i'm not a fan of snake on a plane.<br /><br />there are three potential draws to this film:  the comedy of the situation;  the horror; and  the novelty of hundreds of snakes being of a plane. <br /><br />firstly, this film isn't written as a tongue-in-cheek horror or a comedy, and there are only 1 or 2 points in the film where you'll smile to yourself. if you want to get the feel of the film, the trailer genuinely represents the movie, a horror.<br /><br />secondly, if you're expecting a film full of action and shocks, you won't be disappointed. it doesn't stand out above other movies, but it always keeps your attention.<br /><br />thirdly, although the novelty of snakes of a plane doesn't wear off, but you'll leave the cinema thinking ""what was all the fuss about"".<br /><br />i know this movie has a high rating, but it doesn't add up. a) many of the reviews where written before the film was released and, b) the breakdown of user ratings has a lot less variation than normal 77% of people rating the movie 10/10, with only 7% of people giving it 9/10 - why such an enormous gap?"	1
"i went into this film with expectations, from the hype, that it would be insightful and uplifting. certainly something more than a cheap promotional for the band ""wilco.""<br /><br />instead we get a lot of moping and whining about ""the process,"" a dishonorable and no doubt one-sided portrayal of one band members who was kicked out by the prima donna lead singer/songwriter, a gut-wrenching confession by the fallen member's friend -- for like 18 years -- saying the ""friendship had run its course,"" and this whiny, uncompelling story about how one record label ""hurt their feelings"" by dumping them, only so that the band could immediately get 50 offers from other labels (oh, the tension...not!) they tried their best to make it look like it was a strain, but i suspect it was all smoke and mirrors to generate a tragedy that didn't exist. this doesn't even take into account the long stretches where we get many of their newest songs shoved at us in full without any storyline, insight or even a decent job at cinematography. the strained attempts at emotional sincerity or reasonable perspective on life made me sick to watch.<br /><br />from the film, this band sounds like a bunch of vile little babies who poke around to find a voice they don't have and think they're some kind of guardians for the art of music, which they most definitely are not. and i thought the music sucked, and i couldn't even understand the lyrics due to the mumbling style of the lead singer.<br /><br />i give it a 2/10."	1
"disjointed, unclear, bad screenplay, poor photography and direction...all in all very obviously an ill-conceived first effort at commercial film-making by the good people at tbn.<br /><br />tbn pictures has had great success in the past by helping to bring ""china cry"", the story of nora lam, to the big screen. but ""the omega code"" is an unfortunate miscue. as a christian who supports tbn and a lot of its programming and who loved ""china cry"", i still find it impossible to recommend this film to anyone. they do much good with their ministry, but this isn't an example of it. don't waste your money...go rent ""china cry"" instead."	1
"raising victor vargas fails terribly in what it tries most to be: being real. unfortunately, there is no reality to this film. the characters and situations feel completely artificial and fake.<br /><br />the reason? bad directing. peter sollett uses all the wrong tools in his arsenal. it seems mr. sollett read somewhere that not lighting his film would give it an authentic feel. wrong! it just gives it a badly-made feel. similarly, shaking the camera does not give a documentary style to your film, it just gives the audience a headache and detracts from what's on screen instead of enhance it.<br /><br />of course, what's on screen is so painfully fake, as if mr. sollett wrote his script with the only goal of trying to look ""hip"" to his sundance buddies and show how ""edgy"" a filmmaker he is.<br /><br />overall, the only lasting impression this film leaves you with is what a bad director mr. sollett is. next time, how about taking a few writing and directing classes?"	1
the idea had potential, but the movie was poorly scripted, poorly acted, poorly shot and poorly edited. there are lots of production flaws ... for example, dr. lane's daughter who never ages despite the passing years. wait for video, but don't expect much.	1
interesting to read comments by viewers regarding omega code... many of the overwhelmingly positive comments were lifted almost word for word from tbn broadcasts... the movie looks as if it were made to go directly to video, to be stocked besides the three-part rapture series that was done by some other religious group in the 70s.. dont remember it? you wont remember this one either in a year or two. this is the first movie i have ever seen where it was implied that it was your religious duty to go to it and buy as many tickets as possible to save souls... very shameful... this just goes to show that if you are a televangelist's son, you too can play high-roller hollywood producer with lil ole ladies tithe money...	1
what was this about ?? pre-destination, you can not change the future cause it has already been written ??<br /><br />i'll give it this much. i did want to see what happened next and therefore watched the whole movie. this movie took a concept and made it watchable.<br /><br />if you're looking for a recommendation, see it at matinee prices. no thrills but an interesting concept. they should have left the y2k reference out....	1
"this film had so much promise. i was very excited about this film. in the end, it was laughable at best, painful at worst. the acting styles ran the gamut from really, really, flat (the angels, the wife and daughter) to over-animated (casper's character). i felt that the dialogue was just an attempt to transfer information to the audience instead of real people trying to talk to each other. pay special attention to the scene regarding ""the bug"". it's pretty much an insult to the audience's ability to figure things out. in defense of that scene, though, it got the biggest laugh of the whole movie. i had read that they spent alot of money traveling to various overseas locations. too bad they didn't make use of it. i didn't feel like i was transported to exotic locations. anybody could insert stock footage of the coliseum in rome. however, to end on a positive note, i thought the sets were pretty good. i really liked the graphics that were displayed on the decoding computers. it is my opinion(and that's all it is) that if the schmaltz factor would have been much much lower and the action factor would have been greatly increased, this film would have been good."	1
this movie is not based on the bible. it completely leaves christ out of the movie. they do not show the rapture or the second coming of christ. let alone talk about it. it does not quote from scriptures. the end times are called the great tribulation. the movie does not even show bad times. the seven bowls, seven viles and seven trumpets of judgements are boiled down to a 15 second news cast of the sea changing it's structure. the anti-christ was killed 3 1/2 years into the tribulation and that is how the movie ended. the only part they got correct was there was two prophets. the did not use there names of course because that would be too close to the truth of scriptures. the worst part of it was i really wanted it to be a good movie. i wanted to take unsaved people to it. i feel that the movie is evil. it is a counterfeit just like everything the devil does. i just hope it does not take away from the upcoming movie based on the left behind books.<br /><br />the second problem with the movie is it was just bad. bad acting, bad special effects, bad plot and poor character development. i have seen better episodes of miami vice.	1
i truly wish i was not writing this review. i'm a christian, so i waited anxiously to see this movie. it seemed great -- a christian movie with some fairly famous stars and a plot that seemed intriguing (not that i buy the bible code itself -- you can make it say anything you want. i do, however believe everything inside the bible). so i'm sitting on the edge of my seat enjoying the previews, when the movie comes on and manages to destroy my mood in a matter of minutes. i had to bite my lip to stop from commenting on the terrible writing and acting while i was in the theater (i would have been torn to pieces by the people cheering at the rather clumsy but basically uplifting scenes and gasping at the insanely obvious and predictable tension scenes, i'm sure). once the final credits began to roll, however, i could reflect. there were many parts of the movie i liked -- some mostly unexpected plot twists, some effects that were indeed special (i'm not counting the visions. those were poorly done), and some interesting technical work -- fades, sets, that type of thing. unfortunately, i got the distinct impression that if i read the book of revelation to a monkey and set the monkey in front of a typewriter for an hour, i could've gotten a better script. and the music was beyond cheesy (even for a bond fan who likes kinda cheesy music in scenes of action and intrigue). so i wish i could be like everyone else in the theater -- like the people who came out crying and breathless because of how incredible it was -- but i'm not someone who can be appeased by a writer who throws some words over a biblical shell and slaps a christian stamp on it. i need a good plot and believable dialogue before i can enjoy most movies, and this just didn't have either. i'm sorry, but i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. and that's the tragedy. when will we see some intelligent christian fiction? it has to be out there somewhere...	1
"the more i analyze this film, the worse it becomes. first of all, why a motivational speaker? that part was just stupid. i mean, why would a megalomaniac trying to control the world rely on a motivational speaker? is alexander stone really that disorganized? first he can't decide what he wants to do to control the world, so he looks to the bible for ideas. many of these ideas, i might add, really have no reliability(for example, the part of the ""the houses of ishmael and isaac shall scream out in terror"" could have already happened. it could have been have been the synagogues burned during krystalnacht and the mosques could very well have been the mosques blown up in baghdad or something.) and gillen lane's family! they had no part except to provide a family values platfrom and dab their eyes with water! i might add that since casper van dien/gillen lane is only in his twenties(or that's the impression that i had)and has a ten year child, he had his child during high school. yeah, there goes tbn's family values. also, why did this film have to be so damn propaganda-like? i'll repeat what an earlier reviewer said. the indiana jones flicks use christian mythology as a plot dvice and manipulate it well so that we are intoxicated. this film doesn't do that. the beginnig starts off well, with michael ironsides playing a priest who murders a scholar off some sort and steals the dead guy's omega code. then when confronted by two men who he is obviously afraid of, the two prophets tell him ""tell your master that we are here!"". dominic(ironsides) replies ""he already knows"" and points to a small surveillance camera. that part sent chills up my spine. had only it gone on like that one scene i would have loved this film. i'll give michael york credit: he does a fine job of acting out his character, as does michael ironsides. but the good guys are horrible. i've already went on about lane's family<br /><br />. now that i'm over the acting, i'll get on to plot. this is obviously a baptist film, since our beloved pope of the vatican is portrayed as an oaf. the world domination plot i liked and found plausible and subtle, as were the action sequences were also thrilling and well-done. also another diatribe against the vatican, their leaders are seen as dogmatically minded, since gillen explains to the pope that it's not the end of the world, but the beginning of a new one also, the vatican (or israelis)says their going to secede from the world union aince they used the omega code to control the world. whoever it was, they wouldn't just secede, they'd send over commandoes and kill them. this is the equivalent of america knowing about the kgb going to kill the president and simply saying ""we're not going to talk to you any more!"". come on! i did enjoy the scenes where we see bombers headed towards israel and see them again on the monitor. mediocre in short."	1
if there was ever a call to make a bad film that reflected how stupid humanity could become, this one would take the prize. the plot centers around bible prophecies that lie in hidden messages of the scriptures that prompt a group of power-seeking thugs to attempt total control of the world. just how stupid does this writer believe people to actually be? <br /><br /> the acting was bad at best. casper van dien wasted his talent doing this film. michael york's work was a fair match for the role, since he was the center of the film, and did a good job. <br /><br /> this plot was sickening and very disturbing. no tender or immature minds should see this film. this is how a basic good vs. evil plot can go astray.<br /><br /> there must be a lot of mental disease floating around the film circles, who look for ways to market this type of junk. there must have been something censored out to get a pg-13 rating, but it was still awful.	1
"yes i admit i cried during this movie. it was so incredibly disappointing, that i couldn't help myself but cry. tbn (trinity broadcasting network) has done it again. first with having the million dollar man (ex-professional wrestler) on their program, and now this.<br /><br />the omega code follows a stream of sketchy religiously oriented movies. it was quite amusing, yet at the same time it was disturbing to find it so biblically inaccurate. the movie follows what is known as ""the bible code"" rather than following actual biblical scripture. this film is extremely poorly made; from its writing to its directing to its hilariously horrible acting. its depressing that people actually put effort into this movie. it appeared more like a late night movie someone would watch on the usa channel or a straight to home video rather than a theatrical released movie.<br /><br />i highly recommend you do not watch this movie, even if your life depended on it."	1
.... this movie basks too much in its own innocence. it doesn't tell a story; it's more a big time snooze fest. while the actors are all personable, the story is so trite and goes nowhere. i think victor rasuk has great charisma, but deserves a real film from a real storyteller.	1
"what else is left to say?<br /><br />i've read all the reviews here and most are right on. . however, one person even went so far as to call this movie evil and that satan tainted it (or something along those lines). evil?! wow, what a shocker. . i mean, tbn basically made this film. open your eyes please.<br /><br />anway, this was the very lowest grade of propoghanda nonsense that has come along in years.<br /><br />the most terrifying thing about omega code is how much money they spent to make it. if this movie can be made, there are no limits, and therefore, we have no choice but to get ready for ""yentl 2"", and ""ernest loses the omega codes.""<br /><br />for those of you who are into the biblical stories, the new movie dogma will pickup where omega code never started."	1
"quite honestly, the omega code is the worst movie i have seen in a very long time. during the first 30 minutes i sat stunned in my seat, trying to decide if i should demand a refund. but since i hadn't paid to see it in the first place (passes), i figured i might as well stay. and i didn't think it could possibly get any worse.<br /><br />it did. i will quickly run through the low points (includes some spoilers): the horrible miscasting of casper van dien as gillen lane, a motivational speaker with two phds. the characterization was inconsistent; for example, lane, despite his credentials, is a complete nitwit. then there's the lame-o depiction of the fulfillment of the biblical prophecies; we see a bunch of sensational news soundbites accompanied by ridiculous computer print outs of the translated biblical code. also, terrible ""action"" sequences: lane escapes from tough situations without explanation, and the one time lane actually does seem to be in danger, it turns out to be a dream sequence! that's cute for grammar school writing assignments, but it's an inexcusable plot device in a motion picture. the pacing was bad: after a long opener, the first third of the movie changes scenes every 90 seconds. later, the pacing improves, but there is still far too much unnecessary jumping around. and as someone else mentioned, years pass yet no one (not even lane's young daughter) ages. that was disconcerting.<br /><br />there are a few good things, though. the quality of the film (e.g. lack of graininess) is high and very attractive. the outdoor shots were well done and the location shooting added a touch of realism. also, there are a few moments in the last part of the film when lane calls on god (finally) to help him - this proved to be quite exhilarating - even to me, someone who does not accept jesus as a personal savior. but i liked this because it struck me as being the only genuine scene in the movie. unfortunately, it was followed by major incomprehensibility.<br /><br />the characters, dialogue, direction and acting were all poorly done. michael ironside had nothing to do, and michael york was just weird. i think the producers wanted to do too much; if the plot had been tighter and more focused, and the characterization more fleshed out, the film would have been far better. <br /><br />in a nutshell, the omega code disappoints. definitely do not pay to see this. i give it ** out of ten stars.<br /><br />"	1
i should have known i was in trouble with casper van diem as the lead character. words cannot describe, nor do they do justice to just how terrible this movie was. but please allow me to try to describe it: horrible acting, terrible dialog, corny situations and through it all you get the feeling that you are being force-fed the beliefs and propeganda from the trinity broadcasting network. its a weak attempt at trying to show hollywood that a movie can be entertaining and have a deep, religious message attached to it. they failed miserably. it was clearly the worst movie i have seen in a long time.	1
"i went to see the omega code with a group of other christians totaling about 15 people. we all expected a good piece of christian film-making. what we got was an excruciatingly painful, drawn-out, and pretty boring attempt at a film. it has good looking production values but also has poor acting, a weak script with lousy dialogue, and no real sense of direction. from the first 15 minutes we all knew it would be a long night. we all hated it, and some people in our group placed this movie as reeking of more cheese than ""anaconda."" none of us could believe that the movie lasted less than 2 hours. flashy effects and crisp looking cinematography can't save this bad, bad movie. i'd give it a 3 out of 10, and the rating is only that high because i rented the abominable ""movie"" werewolf (1996) the night before i saw this movie."	1
the omega code was a model of cinematographical inconsistency. there was a bit (but precious little) of good acting, primarily by the two prophets and rostenberg, who only appeared once and had no lines. otherwise the acting was decidedly bad. the plot line was rather weak, and only partially based on already questionable biblical interpretation. certainly not one of the year's best.	1
i am a youth pastor's wife and we took some youth to see this film. we then spent an hour trying to explain it to them. they didn't get it and i didn't enjoy it. it is based on a concept that has run through all three of the major religions of the world (the bible code, the torah code and the code in the koran) and is so questionable as to be laughable. this is not a step forward for christians in the arts, it is a step forward for those who believe we check our brains at the door.	1
"i'm a christian. i have always been skeptical about movies made by christians, however. as a rule, they are ""know-nothings"" when it comes to movie production. i admire tbn for trying to present god and jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen. however, they did a hideous job of it. the acting was horrible, and unless one is familiar with the bible in some fashion, one could not have understood what the movie was trying to get across. not only was the movie terribly made, but the people who made it even had some facts wrong. however, in this ""critique"", those facts are irrelevent and too deep to delve into. in short, the omega code is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen, and i would not recommend it to anyone, except for comic relief from the every day grind."	1
"<br /><br />i would highly recommend seeing this movie. after viewing it, you will be able to walk out of every other bad movie ever saying ""at least it wasn't the omega code.""<br /><br />forget my money, i want my time back!"	1
i sincerely consider this movie as another poor effort of dominican movie industry. the first 30 minutes of the movie are a little funny but then when they switch their role in the society (men doing what women usually do and women doing what men usually do) the movie falls. becoming boring and not funny at all. they let many things without explanation and the end of the movie is predictable. i didn't like the way as a roberto angel played his character and his little either. i went to the movies theater hoping to see a good work but i went out really disappointed.<br /><br />i don't recommend this movie.	1
"i was very disappointed by this film for a few reasons. for the first half hour it's actually pretty decent. although the acting isn't any better then that which you would find in a rap video, its kinda funny and the production value doesn't seem half bad. in fact i almost thought this would be almost as good as perico ripiao (another recent dominican film) which turned out to be much much better than i expected. the plot for the movie revolves around not just cheating husbands but how women are viewed and treated in dominican society as a whole, which makes for a good premise especially in the dominican republic. unfortunately i don't think the makers of this film relies that a good movie is all about how you treat your subject matter, and they f'ing butchered the veal cutlet they had before them. about 30 minutes into the movie the roles of men and women are reversed after the main characters wife puts a kind of spell on him as a result of his cheating habits. not only does this transition happen via what look to be cutting edge, space age, cgi effects dating to what i'm guessing would be the 70's, but the whole plot just goes down the drain. the rest of the movie is nothing but cheesy predictable situations, and clever one liners. to top it all off (and i guess i should warn you now **spoiler alert**) it all turns out to be a dream. oh my who didn't see that coming? oh man i almost forgot the most ridiculous thing about the movie. well after about an hour into it i start thinking ""hmmmm something just doesn't seem right about the sound track but what can it be??"" and then it hits me half of the music in the movie was taken from a video game called king of fighter 95.<br /><br />when oh when dr will you give us a film we can call a work of art?!?! perhaps a comedy to match france's amelie, or an action flick to match thailand's ong-bak, an animation as akira was to japan, a witty crime thriller as layer cake was to england, or a socio-awakening journey as waking life had here in the states.<br /><br />...i would give it a 1 but i've seen much worse come out of dr, search los jodedores and you'll know what i'm talking about."	1
"someone will have to explain to me why every film that features poor people and adopts a pseudo-gritty look is somehow seen as ""realistic"" by some people.<br /><br />i didn't see anything realistic about the characters (although the actors did their best with really bad parts) or the situations. instead, i saw a forced, self-conscious effort at being ""edgy"", ""gritty"" and ""down and dirty"".<br /><br />sadly, it takes a lot more than hand-holding the camera without rhyme or reason and failing to light the film to achieve any of the above qualities in any significant way.<br /><br />it's a sad commentary on the state of independent film distribution that the only films that see the inside of a movie theater are nowadays all carbon copies, with bad cinematography, non-existent camera direction and a lot of swearing striving to pass themselves as ""art"".<br /><br />it's little wonder that films like ""in the bedroom"" or ""about schmidt"" get such raves. i found them to be meandering and very average, but compared to the current slew of independent clones like ""raising victor vargas"" they are outright brilliant and inspired.<br /><br />a few years ago seeing an ""independent"" film meant that you would likely be treated to some originality and a lot of energy and care, and maybe a few technical glitches caused by the low budgets, nowadays, it means that chances are you'll get yet another by-the-numbers, let's-shake-the-camera-around-for-two-hours attempt at placating the lack of taste of independent distributors. and of course all that to serve characters and situations that are completely unreal and contrived.<br /><br />is it any surprise that the independent marketplace has fewer and fewer surviving companies? not at all when you see films like raising victor vargas that do nothing but copy the worst of the films that preceded them."	1
it has a great name, but thats it and you wont get more than that for your money, in fact the first 30-40mins of the movie you might find it some kind of funny but after that the story goes from one side to another with no particular reason and you just cant understand whats happening until the action its gone.<br /><br />and yet the producers (roberto angel salcedo) calls him an actor, but i don't think the way he does could be called nothing but overacting!!....period. the little kid who plays as his son has totally no sense of acting and i believe it was just a favor he did or something because he had no clue of what he was doing.<br /><br />for some reason while doing the casting they thought that by casting comedians they could made it, but they didn't!! and sometimes the tasteless cheap humor its so bad, i don't buy it.<br /><br />but hopefully this is as bad as it gets. to make people accept those dvd's to the good taste public they will have to offer some food with it, that might work out.<br /><br />maka	1
the film is poorly casted, except for some familiar old hollywood names. other performances by unknown names (i.e., jennifer gabrielle) are uninspiring. i have seen other films by this director, unfortunately this is one of his worst. perhaps this is a reflection of the screenplay? <br /><br />in a positive note, kim bassinger's and pat morita's performance saved the movie from oblivion. i enjoyed pat more in karate kid, though. there are many good movies to see, and in short, this one is not one of them. save your money and the celluloid. <br /><br />jason vanness	1
"one of the worst films i have ever seen. how to define ""worst?"" i would prefer having both eye balls yanked out and then be forced to tap dance on them than ever view this pitiful dreck again. somehow, one-hit wonder zwick manages a film that simultaneously offends elvis fans, mary kay saleswomen, las vegas, gays, fbi agents and the rest of humanity with any intelligence with a shoddy, sloppy farce so forced it deserves to be forsaken ed. how elvis presley enterprises could allow the rights of actual elvis songs to be used in a film with a central premise that seems to be ""the only good elvis presley imitator is a dead one"" is beyond me. the worst part of this mess - and that takes some work - is the mangled script: in 1958, elvis' words and songs that he would speak/perform in the 1970's are quoted! worst special effect? that oscar would go to the moron who decided that elvis' grave, potentially the most photographed/recognizable grave in the world, resembles a pyramid with a gold record glued atop and is situated in the middle of a park somewhere. potentially, this film's biggest audience would be elvis fans. however, the rampant stupidity (nixon gave elvis a dea badge, not fbi credentials...and i could go on and on) actually undercuts that conventional wisdom. ugh. i used the word ""wisdom"" to describe this stupid movie. this is truly a horrible, horrible film."	1
"i saw this movie on a westbound american airlines flight. it was so bad it actually made the flight seem longer. the plot had potential (who wouldn't love a movie about a woman who accidentally kills every elvis impersonator she meets?) but it got screwed up a million different times by really poor writing. towards the end is an embarrassingly bad scene where a gang of elvis impersonators is on the roof of a casino reshipping the sky thinking he's going to return, then a group of stars moves together to form an ""elvis"" constellation, which promptly shoots a bolt of lightning at the impersonators, sending them crashing through the roof. bad...really bad. which is the theme for the whole movie. i'd avoid this one at all costs."	1
"being an elvis fan, i can't understand how this proyect could be done. is by far the worst elvis related movie of all time, totally unfunny, silly and plenty of mistakes about the king. come on, elvis' grave in a public park? a mention about suspicious minds in 1958?...and these are just two examples. some people in the cast tries to do their best, mike starr is funny (specially as an impersonator), the tom hanks cameo is a surprise, but the guy playing the young elvis sucks.overall the movie lacks fun and becomes more boring minute after minute. if you want to see an ultra cheap, insane but absolutely funny little film related to elvis, i truly recommend you ""bubba ho-tep"" instead of this mess."	1
darkly comic serendipity about a cosmetics saleswoman, with odd ties to elvis presley, running into a sea of elvis impersonators while speaking at conventions in nevada...and accidentally killing each one of them through little fault of her own. kim basinger, a still-attractive actress of considerable merit, likes to pick quirky movies to play in, but this dreadful screenplay (by mitchell ganem and adam-michael garber) hasn't an iota of good humor. the stereotypes and low-ball gags are not meant to be the stuff of classic comedy, but even on a shambling, shameful level, the picture is crude and sloppy. if you do watch, see if you can count how much extraneous shots there are of basinger behind the wheel of her pink cadillac, hands always in the same position and a non-plussed look on her face. hopefully both she and elvis were well paid. no stars from ****	1
omg! the only reason i'm giving this movie a 2 instead of a 1 is because tom hanks is funny as an elvis-in-the-box. apart from that, how did this halfway decent cast sign on to do such a lame movie?? maybe it seemed like a good idea at the time... there are no laughs to mention, the stereotypes are pathetic, the cast is wasted, the direction is amateurish. now that i think about it, most of the blame probably lies with the director, joel zwick. he brings out nothing but flat performances from all involved. don't waste your time like i did; but then, i enjoy a good train wreck. geez, now the system is telling me i need more lines-- here ya go: this movie should be called return to sender. okay, now that was funnier than anything in the movie...	1
elvis has left the building and he's lucky because he didn't have to watch this unfunny stinker. scene after scene director joel zwick finds ways to make an unfunny script even less amusing. filled with unfunny deaths, trite gay characteratures, and hack jokes, this film is more desperate than amusing. this is the sort of film that makes one hope kim basinger follows doris day into premature retirement. let us remember her the way she was (talented) and not what she's become. david leisure, the delicious dennis richards and the rest are all wasted talents here. zwick finds a way to minimize their talents at every turn. the guy playing elvis sounds more like gomer than the king.the only really good bit of casting is the young girl who plays basinger as a preteen. she really looks like her and is actually pretty good. the only other reason to watch this film at all is to look for the tom hanks cameo. the cameo isn't all that funny, but at least its not painful. one has to wonder if zwick has incriminating pictures of hanks or something that would make him do this movie.	1
i have absolutely no knowledge of author phillipa pearce or any of her novels and if tom`s midnight garden is typical of her work i probably would have had little interest in her books as a child . when i was a child i wasn`t really interested in litreture unless it had soldiers fighting monsters complete with a high body count <br /><br />judging by this film version of tom`s midnight garden i guess pearce writes for lower middle class kids since much of the story of revolves around protagonist tom long moving to a house with no garden then suddenly finding a metaphysical one . having a garden of your own was no doubt something that working class people didn`t have in the 1950s so i guess there`s some political class ridden subtext there somewhere . there`s also a romance involving a young girl called hattie but again are cynical kids amoured by love stories ? perhaps the worst criticism is that very little in the way of excitement or adventure happens within the narrative <br /><br />this is a childrens film that seems dated by its source . it`s inoffensive but i`m surprised by its high rating by the imdb voters . i wonder how many of them would have given it so many high marks if they were 10 year olds who`d just seen the lord of the rings trilogy ?	1
raising victor vargas: a review<br /><br />you know, raising victor vargas is like sticking your hands into a big, steaming bowl of oatmeal. it's warm and gooey, but you're not sure if it feels right. try as i might, no matter how warm and gooey raising victor vargas became i was always aware that something didn't quite feel right. victor vargas suffers from a certain overconfidence on the director's part. apparently, the director thought that the ethnic backdrop of a latino family on the lower east side, and an idyllic storyline would make the film critic proof. he was right, but it didn't fool me. raising victor vargas is the story about a seventeen-year old boy called, you guessed it, victor vargas (victor rasuk) who lives his teenage years chasing more skirt than the rolling stones could do in all the years they've toured. the movie starts off in `ugly fat' donna's bedroom where victor is sure to seduce her, but a cry from outside disrupts his plans when his best-friend harold (kevin rivera) comes-a-looking for him. caught in the attempt by harold and his sister, victor vargas runs off for damage control. yet even with the embarrassing implication that he's been boffing the homeliest girl in the neighborhood, nothing dissuades young victor from going off on the hunt for more fresh meat. on a hot, new york city day they make way to the local public swimming pool where victor's eyes catch a glimpse of the lovely young nymph judy (judy marte), who's not just pretty, but a strong and independent too. the relationship that develops between victor and judy becomes the focus of the film. the story also focuses on victor's family that is comprised of his grandmother or abuelita (altagracia guzman), his brother nino (also played by real life brother to victor, silvestre rasuk) and his sister vicky (krystal rodriguez). the action follows victor between scenes with judy and scenes with his family. victor tries to cope with being an oversexed pimp-daddy, his feelings for judy and his grandmother's conservative catholic upbringing.<br /><br />the problems that arise from raising victor vargas are a few, but glaring errors. throughout the film you get to know certain characters like vicky, nino, grandma, judy and even judy's best friend melonie. the problem is, we know nothing of victor vargas except that he is the biggest gigolo in the neighborhood. we know that he knows how to lick his lips, and comb his fro, and carry himself for the sake of wooing girls into the sack, but that's all. we know that nino plays piano, and quiet well, you could see it by the awards on the family piano. we know his sister nicki, is a gossip-loving girl with an invested interest in watching tv. we know that grandma is a hard-working traditional latina woman who's trying to raise her kids with conservatively in a world of excess corruption. yet where is the titular character, victor vargas? he's in this movie somewhere, but we only know what the movie tells us. this is by far the film's biggest flaw. victor vargas isn't so much a character but a ping-pong ball, bouncing between scenes with judy and his grandmother, but we never get to know who victor vargas really is. this is important because as i've mentioned the only thing we know of victor vargas is that he's a sexually active teenager with a libido the size of manhattan. he's a total alpha-male. victor vargas is not the kind of character i sympathize with at all. why should anyone? so by the end of the movie, in the aftermath of the climax are we truly led to believe that somehow victor vargas has attained any depth and learned the errors of his ways? how could such a two-dimensional character have any depth? if only the director had worried a little more about fleshing out his main character instead of worrying about getting that perfect hand-held shot.<br /><br />raising victor vargas brings to life the world of the latino inner-city neighborhood to the big screen. something that few films have done before in the past. the film has been complimented for feeling so real, and i won't<br /><br />argue with that. i haven't seen this level of reality since cbs aired survivor. seriously, although the movie has some nice shots of the city, the writer/director peter sollett was way too dependent on close-ups and hand-held shots. this problem is particularly noticed in indoor scenes that are so claustrophobic i was forced to perform deep-breathing exercises to keep from passing out. as the film continues, the shots get tighter and tighter with faces cropped from brow to chin on the screen; you can practically smell victor vargas's cheap cologne. the overall effect is unrealistic in contrast. the indoor scenes of inner-city apartments make them look small and cramp, which is not true. i've been in those type apartments; i used to live in one. they're not splendorous but they have high ceilings and they're decent living spaces. by the movie's standards you'd think that these apartments were 5x5 cells of brick-and-mortar, chipped paint and cracked walls. unfortunately, sollett's constant use of close-ups and one particularly bad shot with a zoom-in on one scene come off as totally amateurish. but raising victor vargas is only sollett's second film, and his most well known, a solid effort in filmmaking that will hopefully get better as he continues to make films. one review i read summarized the movie as, `ethnicity for ethnicity's sake,' and i cannot agree more. if victor vargas were truly a great film and story, then the characters' applicability wouldn't matter whether they were latino, chinese, etc. yet if you were to take this story and stick it in middle-class suburbia with a bunch of teeny-bopper white kids the results wouldn't be such glowing reviews, and we'd see the film's flaws more clearly. indeed, some other aspects of the use of latinos in this film bother me. while some aspects of victor vargas are accurate others i have to question. for example, victor, nino and vicky all share the same room to sleep. this set off an alarm for me because it seemed contrary to what i believe. any self-respecting latino family wouldn't have two older brothers sharing the same room with a thirteen-year old girl. at first i was unsure, perhaps i was wrong, but after speaking with my grandmother i knew my problem with this was justified. considering how conservative the grandmother is, you'd think that vicky would have been sleeping in her room.<br /><br />as a latino who grew up in a somewhat conservative cuban household, raised by my grandmother while my mother was working full-time, i could relate to the movie in many ways, which is why my critical viewpoints are bittersweet because i really wanted to love this movie. unfortunately, my lack of respect for victor vargas sabotaged my feelings for the film. maybe it's because victor vargas reminds me of those guys who were getting laid while i was playing with my sega genesis when i was seventeen. maybe it's because without any further introspection by the film, victor vargas is merely a stereotypical hot-blooded latino, who'll just end up shouting to girls from his car, `hey bay-bee, ju want to get into my luv mah-cheen?' either way i don't like him, so ultimately how can i like a film about him? so if you'll excuse me, i'm going to go stick my hands into a bowl of grits.<br /><br />	1
"i notice that the previous reviewer (who appears to be still at school) gave this movie a very good review and i can only assume that this is because the reviewer hasn't seen the far superior 1989 bbc adaptation of this classic novel. the major problem i had with this (1999) version was the casting of anthony way as tom long. anthony way was a talented boy treble who shot to fame after appearing in the tv mini-series ""the choir"". i can only assume that he was cast for the role of tom long on the strength of his excellent acting in ""the choir"". unfortunately the small boy who appeared in ""the choir"" had grown into a tall and gangly youth by the time ""tom's midnight garden"" was filmed and as such anthony fails to convince as schoolboy tom. it is too far a stretch of the imagination to believe that tom (as played by anthony) would befriend the far younger hatty. in the 1989 bbc version tom and hatty are much closer in age and the development of their friendship is so much more believable. for a 1999 movie even the special effects fail to convince and are not any noticeable improvement on the 1989 tv effects. the casting and acting of this version are inferior to the earlier adaptation and all in all the movie was a lack lustre version of a true classic. as a final observation i would point out that the vhs of the 1989 bbc version fetches well over £20.00 second hand whereas a new dvd of this version can be bought for under £5.00, need i say more?"	1
if you like bad movies, this is the one to see. it's incredibly low-budget special effects (you'll see what i mean) and use of non-actors was what gave this film it's charm. if you're bored with a group of friends, i highly recommend renting this b movie gem. it's mulletrific!	1
i would love to have that two hours of my life back. it seemed to be several clips from steve's animal planet series that was spliced into a loosely constructed script. don't go, if you must see it, wait for the video ...	1
a difficult film to categorize. i was never giving it 110% concentration & consequently as simple as the plot appeared i couldn't say for certain exactly who was doing what amongst the american fbi characters & what their roles were. nor could i take the irwins seriously as film characters when their lines & scenes were all in the style of one of his shows, not acted out.<br /><br />this is nothing more than a glorified episode of a discovery tv show, with a largely insignificant sub plot going on, which just seemed to get in the way. however as any irwin show is always worth a watch, this film is well worth a look too, but not on christmas day. talking of which, i've better things to do too than be on here.<br /><br />a high 4/10	1
on steve irwin's show, he's hillarious. he doesn't even try to be funny and he just is but his movie wasn't even what i would call a movie-i mean when that guy on his car is trying to kill him he's just saying 'oh, this is one nasty bloke!' and looking straight into the camera. he put his face in the camera too much! and then when the guy falls off the car wouldn't you expect him to be dead? and terri had the worst acting i'd ever seen! like when the crocodile almost ate steve she just says 'steve'. she didn't sound scared or anything, it was just 'steve'. i mean i hate to sound mean but that was not worth seeing. i love steve irwin but his movie was just too stupid.	1
"i think the croc hunter is a pretty cool guy! i know i wouldn't have the nerve to go even 5 feet away from a croc.<br /><br />but, everything in this movie is bad. farting jokes, people getting eaten, and the skit about the president all make the movie one of the worst of all time.<br /><br />it's a really bad film that you have to stay away from. all the ""jokes"" are so juvenile that you will find yourself laughing because they are so stupid. the plot is so bad that you wonder if the screenwriter is 4 years old.<br /><br />i'm surprised the croc hunter did not beg the crocodile to eat him after he saw this."	1
"gday mates! just watched croc hunter the movie. it was alright but the show seems more real. this just seemed like a longer animalplanet episode with funnier lines and more characters. a few things: steve described snakes fangs like hypodermic needles. yeeeowch! for reals you know that hurts. and cant they jump up high? hes all grabbin them by the tail and stuff. there was two major cleavage shots in this movie. when terry find that baby joey she goes like ""we have to nurture them, just like a baby"". woah! i thought she was gonna up & breast feed that kid. that woulda made it pg-13 though. while on terry, did anyone notice on the movie and a lot of the show terry's knowledge on ritual mating. she knows her sex stuffs. movie takes place in queensland, austrailia. i want a koala, dingo, and joey!<br /><br />steve's dog sui actually has a purpose in this movie. albeit a small one which proves useless against the dynamite-wielding hottie.<br /><br />oh and if anyone else watches this, try and agree with me in saying that country bumpkin fat lady with the herd of dogs was right in shotgunning the croc. he was eating her sheep!! i would be mad too!"	1
"so, steve irwin. you have to admire a man who is not only willing to throw himself into a river that clearly is filled with crocs, snakes, lizards, tons of poop from the aforementioned reptiles, and mud, not only daily, but with enthusiasm. he was never able to make me want to do it, but he managed to make his wife come close.<br /><br />this movie does not fall into my parallel universe of film category - the films for people who just had their teeth drilled, have a migraine, or have no film experience and therefore like quiet mediocrity (currently well populated by disney films). it's too noisy. well, steve is too noisy. he's just so happy all the time, and would cut right through the blasé' teenager (i can hear it now: ""that movie was so stupid"") or the tylenol with codeine. i'd say his enthusiasm is catching, but if it was, i would own a room full of snakes, and that hasn't happened yet. i agreed they're beauties, but i'm still not going to pet them.<br /><br />plot was indeed predictable. bad guys were so bad, for a minute there i thought i was shopping at a consumer electronic superstore. but the movie was filled with animals, and steve and terri, which is why i watched it. that plot (if you could call it that) was really more of a reason to throw yet another croc in a truck. my expectations were low and stayed that way.<br /><br />i was hoping, though, that there would be a bit of a sequel, where steve and terri (having worked on their acting skills) have a movie with a real plot and more animals with fur. i still can't believe we won't see steve anymore. i hope that terri and the children continue to be involved in the australia zoo and the discovery channel, at least. i can't imagine seeing a crocodile without having some member of the irwin family telling me forcefully how wonderful that croc is. crikey!"	1
"i caught this at a test screening. all i can say is: what...the...hell? this movie plays out about as smoothly as mickey mouse reading the script for ""scarface."" it's bizarre beyond making the slightest bit of sense; and even if you do leave your brain in the car, the film is still so bizarre that it isn't even funny.<br /><br />the plot involves crocodile hunter steve irwin trying to ""save"" a crocodile which contains a cia probe. the cia comes after irwin to get their probe back, irwin mistakes them for poachers, and sets out to ""stop"" them.<br /><br />that's about all the story there is; the rest is over-the-top lampooning of australian culture (""didja see dat?"" and ""crikey!"") and strangely choreographed action sequences. at one point, irwin mounts a speeding rv and knife fights with a cia agent on top of it. yes, that's right: steve irwin knife fights a guy on top of an rv. let that be your guide for this ridiculously bad film."	1
"ok, first of all, steve irwin, rest in peace. you were loved by many fans. now...this movie wasn't a movie at all. it was ""the crocodile hunter"" tv program with bad acting, bad scripts, and bad directing in between steve capturing or teaching us about animals. he was entertaining as an animal seeker/specialist. millions will miss him. but the whole movie idea was a big mistake. the plot was so broken, it was almost non-existent. casting was horrible. the acting wasn't even worth elementary school-level actors. the direction must be faulted as well. if you can't get a half-way decent performance out of your actors, no matter how bad the script is, you must not be that good in the first place. i could have written a better script. i wish i had never been to see this movie. of course, i watched it for $3 ($1.50 for me, $1.50 for my son.) while out with friends who insisted upon seeing this instead of scooby doo live action. my son, who is not so discriminating, liked the movie alright, but he still has never asked to see it again. if you want fond memories of steve irwin, buy his series on dvd. avoid this movie like the plague. if i were steve, i know i wouldn't want to be remembered for this movie. respect him: avoid this movie!"	1
"this movie has a very broadway feel - the backdrop, the acting, the 'noise'- and yet that's all it has. some 'sense' of a broadway without the bang. <br /><br />the movie is slow-paced, the picture disjointed, the singing 'pops up' on you so that you suddenly are reminded it's a musical. <br /><br />disappointing: sinatra <br /><br />intolerable: sinatra's fiancé---surely, the pitch and the accent of her voice was unnecessary. <br /><br />tolerable: mr ""i remember the numbers on my dice"" <br /><br />delight: brando's understated singing (very biased!)<br /><br />surprise: how much jean simmons looks like vivien leigh in her havana scenes. it's the bone structure! how i would've killed to have seen miss leigh in a role challenging brando again."	1
en route to a small town that lays way off the beaten track (but which looks suspiciously close to a freeway), a female reporter runs into a strange hitch-hiker who agrees to help direct her to her destination. the strange man then recounts a pair of gruesome tales connected to the area: in the first story, an adulterous couple plot to kill the woman's husband, but eventually suffer a far worse fate themselves when they are attacked by a zombie; and in the second story, a group of campers have their vacation cut short when an undead outlaw takes umbrage at having his grave peed on.<br /><br />the zombie chronicles is an attempt by writer garrett clancy and director brad sykes at making a zombie themed anthologya nice idea, but with only two stories, it falls woefully short. and that's not the only way in which this low budget gore flick fails to deliver: the acting is lousy (with joe haggerty, as the tale-telling ebenezer jackson, giving one of the strangest performances i have ever seen); the locations are uninspired; the script is dreary; there's a sex scene with zero nudity; and the ending.... well, that beggars belief.<br /><br />to be fair, some of sykes' creative camera-work is effective (although the gimmicky technique employed as characters run through the woods is a tad overused) and joe castro's cheapo gore is enthusiastic: an ear is bitten off, eyeballs are plucked out, a face is removed, brains are squished, and there is a messy decapitation. these positives just about make the film bearable, but be warned, the zombie chronicles ain't a stroll in the park, even for seasoned viewers of z-grade trash.<br /><br />i give the zombie chronicles 2/10, but generously raise my rating to 3 since i didn't get to view the film with the benefit of 3d (although i have a sneaking suspicion that an extra dimension wouldn't have made that much of a difference).	1
"i never was an avid viewer of ""crocodile hunter"", but did occasionally see an episode, or a bit of an episode, and when the news spread about steve irwin's death from a stingray attack in 2006, it certainly caught my attention. this movie, with steve and his wife, terri, playing themselves, but in a fictional story, was released in 2002, but i didn't hear of it until several years later, and even after that, it took me a while to get around to seeing it. well, now i have seen it, and after looking here first (more than once), and seeing its rating, i was not surprised at how unimpressive it turned out to be, though it could have been a bit better. apparently, it's supposed to be a comedy, so a major problem with it is that it isn't very funny at all.<br /><br />a u.s. satellite beacon falls down from space and lands in australia, where it is swallowed by a crocodile! while steve and terri irwin are on a mission to capture this crocodile from a place where it terrorizes the cattle on a ranch owned by the crazy brozzie drewitt, and are unaware of what's inside it, two cia agents are sent to australia to retrieve the beacon! the agents are assisted by jo buckley, and the ranch owner and her dogs might make the mission more difficult for them! on steve and terri's mission, they face other types of dangerous wildlife, not just the crocodile, and since they have no clue that the croc has anything unusual inside it, when steve sees the cia agents after them, he mistakes them for poachers! <br /><br />not only did i not laugh once while watching this film, the only part that really made me smile was steve irwin using a big snake to scare off one of the cia agents. apart from that, i don't think i found anything even mildly amusing. it's also a bit of an incoherent mess, switching back and forth from the australian outback to the cia headquarters, and it seems like clips from ""crocodile hunter"" and clips from an action thriller (or something like that) put together for some reason. also added to that mix are the ranch scenes, which also seem to be from somewhere else, and as funny as brozzie drewitt, played by magda szubanski, is supposed to be, she's not. at one point, we see her farting, so we have a fart joke, a major cliché in modern comedy! are they so hard to resist?! i also found the typical ""crocodile hunter"" scenes, with steve wrestling crocodiles and holding other dangerous creatures and talking about them to viewers, to be tedious, but i guess the fact that i was never a devout fan of the show didn't help.<br /><br />steve irwin was admired by many as a conservationist, and is sadly missed by them, while there are also those who say he messed with nature and had it coming to him. no matter which side you're on, ""the crocodile hunter: collision course"" is not a well crafted movie. i'm sure it does help if you're a big steve irwin fan, but even if you are, there's no guarantee that you would like this movie, as some fans clearly haven't been impressed. in fact, it seems that some of them have found this movie to be worse than i have, so maybe it won't help. like i said, there's no guarantee. i would say whatever you may think of steve irwin and his show, this movie was unnecessary. the attempt to combine what is usually seen in ""crocodile hunter"" with a fictional story unfortunately failed, and a viewer may find that this film seems longer than ninety minutes!"	1
"some people say steve irwin's larrikin antics and gregarious personality are only an act. watch this film: it's obvious he can't act.<br /><br />steve irwin, dangerman star of the small screen in his *crocodile hunter diaries*, *croc files* and eponymous *crocodile hunter* series (you see a naming trend here, or is it just me?), rockets his larger-than-strife persona to the big screen with *crocodile hunter: collision course* (yup  there's a definite trend of words beginning with 'c') - basically an episode of *crocodile hunter* mashed together with a b-movie.<br /><br />on a mission to relocate a big croc to save it from being shot by an eccentric farmer (magda szubanski), steve and wife terri are unaware that the croc is being tracked by american spies (lachy hulme and kenneth ransom), out to recover a spy satellite beacon it has swallowed. will it hurt my credibility to say ""they're on a collision course with wackiness""? (what credibility? - ed note.)<br /><br />the plot is irrelevant, as it is steve's animal magnetism that propels the film. if you find his persona trying, the film is a failure, but if you're a fan of either him (as a businessman, conservationist or just plain ass-klown) or his television shows, expect more of the same on a wide-screen budget.<br /><br />john stainton, faithful liege, best mate and helmer of the crocodile hunter *oeuvre* (can it be called that with a straight face?), writes and directs with the same provincial swagger that made steve a household wildlife jester.<br /><br />the most jarring aspect of this movie is that steve (one of the few people for whom you can actually hear the exclamation points going by as he speaks) and terri (steve's spouse of 10 years, fiercest ally and closest friend) treat it like it is one of their documentaries, breaking the ""fourth wall"" and speaking directly to the camera, whilst all the other characters behave as if they're in a bad movie (well). it wouldn't be so incongruous if steve and terri were kept separated from the rest of the characters  but when the bad americans constantly threaten steve's life, we confused viewers must ask ourselves why the indifferent camera crew doesn't at least call the cops if not try to poke the bad guys in the eye with the boom mics, or run screaming into the bush  anything but continue filming casually with great lighting, crisp audio and seven action angles. <br /><br />while terri is unfairly painted as steve's mildly incompetent sidekick (her acting consists of boldly inept line reads and gadding about in pear-shaped-buttock-hugging jeans - for the last, i'm not complaining), steve goes about his business-as-usual of show-and-tell with creatures intent on killing him, doing all his stunts himself because, well, to him they're not really stunts, just a day at the office. <br /><br />of course, watching this madman's koo-koo adventures after his tragic death in september 2006 casts a strange detachment over the proceedings. but to those of us who never met him, this kind of malarkey (as well as various incarnations of the *crocodile hunter* series in constant re-runs) keeps him as alive as ever in our crocodile burrows. the wrenching reality of his absence will only be apparent to those nearest him. and i truly wish them the best in following in his outsize footprints <br /><br />so enjoy this diversion for what it is  a half-baked movie featuring a full-on legend. he died doing what he loved  interacting with wildlife - and he could never have asked for more of his first feature film in portraying him doing just that.<br /><br />(movie maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)"	1
the movie has several story lines that follow several different characters. the different story lines don't feel like one whole complete piece which makes this comedy a very incoherent one and gets even annoying to watch at times.<br /><br />it may sound weak and cliché but it's true; you're way better of watching the crocodile hunter series on the discovery channel with steve and terri irwin. it's more fun and even more hilarious than this movie is. i'm sure both cast and crew had lots of fun making this movie but the movie doesn't give us the viewers much pleasure. for a comedy it simply isn't funny enough and steve and terri irwin just aren't good actors, not even when they play themselves! their antics are simply not good enough to make an entire movie around and their scene's feel long, distracting and unnecessary and even annoying at times.<br /><br />the movie had quite some potential, i mean steve irwin is one character that in a strange way is both intriguing and hilarious to watch, so when i first heard that they were making a movie about 'the crocodile hunter' my first reaction was; brilliant! the movie however heavily suffers from its weak story and the incoherent story lines with uninteresting and unfunny characters. the movie does has a certain entertainment value, at least enough to make this movie watchable for at least once but still, i must certainly wouldn't recommend this movie.<br /><br />watching this movie felt like a waste of time. still this movie might be watchable just once, when it gets on tv, on a rainy afternoon. it does has some good moments but the story lines really completely ruin the movie and its potential.<br /><br />4/10	1
"i couldn't watch more than 14 minutes of it. it's a great combination of really bad acting and really bad directing. the shots used are disgusting, they broke the 180 degrees angle all the time. my head hurts try to watch that load of ""you know what"". dirt on the ""mystery machine"" window make you see light from the lighting on the windows...annoying. what else... it's so badly framed all the time it's just make you want to scream at that lady directing there. i only directed short films, but i'm pretty sure i'd be way better than that directing a feature film.... the story is unbelievable, just the long french kissing scene at the beginning tell you that it's gonna be pretty awful. so pretty much, try to avoid this really bad movies at all cost, it'll save you the 5 bucks or so for the rental, and that 1h30 hour of your life you'll never get back..."	1
"if you liked ""blair with"" you'll like this one. it has the same lousy camera-work and soundtrack, and it has the same non-existent plot and suspenseful moments.<br /><br />it also has tom savini, so if you like romero's ""dawn of the dead"" or tarantino and rodriguez' ""from dusk till dawn"" you're in for a treat. he is an icon and a very good actor as well.<br /><br />no, seriously. this movie is definitely the lousiest movie i've seen in a long time, and i've seen quite a few movies -- bad ones as well. i can tell you that i find most horror movies entertaining in some respect, but this was just a pure waste of time.<br /><br />the only reason why i gave this movie 2 instead of 1, was the naked chicks and the hot action with all the sharp-looking plastic teeth... no, i'm just kidding. i must have missed before i hit ""submit"" on the vote form.<br /><br />stay away, even though it has sexy girls with teeth on the cover!"	1
"when teenagers go on a trip in a camper van there are many clichés that you can guarantee will follow.<br /><br />1)the teenagers will be warned not to go where they are going by a crazy local. dan van husen handles that with ridiculous exposition about deadly sirens. what, who, how and why are handled in one almost unintelligible burst. 2)the van will break down. 3)whilst looking for help the group will be split up and be picked off one by one by whatever monster they have been warned about.4)they will find a house inhabited by a madman, he will capture them. 5) the house will have a phone but it will not work, it will be disturbingly decorated, there will be flickering neon light, spiders and maggots. 6)the madman will catch them as they try to escape in a vehicle that won't start (here the high speed getaway was to be made on a tractor). 7)the madman will be seemingly killed only to come back from the dead for a cheap, weak scare and will then be killed properly. 8)only a girl will be left alive from the group. 9)there will be an unnecessary twist at the end. <br /><br />add to these elements naked sirens (who the characters seem to react to in startling different ways despite the fact that everyone that sees them is supposed to fall into lust with them immediately) that seduce and kill the teens, throats being ripped out and bodies being pulled in half and you have something resembling a twelve year old boys dream movie.<br /><br />i think it is only fair to say that my opinion of the director and his previous work is as low as it is possible to be but i am happy to point out that there are a few elements that boarder on pleasurable and are a great improvement on his previous film, darkhunters, which is one of the worst films i have ever seen. at times the cinematography is very good, the music and editing are a cut above his previous films and some other low budget horror movies. i was impressed to hear that it was achieved with a third of the money spent on the previous monstrosity. however, the worst things about this movie are not to be found in the body of the film, it is ultimately a mildly diverting if pointless movie that has been done time and time again, but amongst the dvd extras.<br /><br />if you do rent this film i implore you to listen to the director's commentary it is beyond belief. there is more to say about this than the film itself. one staggering part of the commentary is the director's claim that the film is cliché leaden because it was a preconceived idea. he says it is a deliberate attempt to use all of the clichés and openly he wonders if ""people will get it"". <br /><br />i'm afraid to say that if this is supposed to be a clever nod and a wink to films of the past and the genre clichés within them then it is not wittily scripted enough, acted in an appropriate tone nor directed with enough style to work. if this film was made to order it leads me to ask one question; ""what was the point?"" this is s afilm that just slips right into the canon of bad horror movies, any attempt to do something clever or different haven't worked.<br /><br />the next nugget of brilliance is a conversation about the snobbery towards digital film formats. they rightly point out that digital is often synonymous with cheapness and ease of use. however, the best moment of the conversation comes when they bemoan the fact that when michael mann makes a film in the format he is branded as a visionary. there is a simple distinction to be made here; mann is a talented director who will use the format to fit his story and style, roberts is a horror hack who uses it to produce bottom shelf genre pictures . i think the differences are obvious and the comparison is not only arrogant but redundant.<br /><br />the best moment is reserved for robert's comments about people who have taken the time to review his previous film. those who didn't like it are generalised as 'geeks' and he even goes as far as to single out specific people for having the nerve to voice their opinion in forums that encourage them to do just that. i must admit i was slightly disappointed that my review of his last film wasn't singled out for ridicule. the tirade goes further as the group joke about norwegian reviewers, complete with 'hilarious' accents to imply that people from norway wouldn't know a good film simply because of where they are born. as always these sorts of comments say more about those saying them than those they are targeting, they simply make the director and his friends look ignorant.<br /><br />the package in rounded out with a tasteful featurette about how the sirens were cast. robert's swears blind in voice over, 'i didn't want to make a film that was like baywatch' as we see audition tapes of topless and naked girls writhing around on the ground. there is also a simpering, self-indulgent documentary about the making of darkhunters during which robert's says that a reviewer has claimed that forest is ""the best british film in years"". i don't know who he is trying to convince. at one point in the commentary track robert's says jokingly ""i can see people sitting at home saying ""this isn't amazing, its sh$t"" he isn't wrong."	1
"ok me and a friend rented this a few days ago because we like to keep track of b-movies since we do them ourselves. anyway, the cover contained blood and weird looking naked girls with fangs and stuff... and tom savini! there is just no way this movie can fail! right? wrong!! it just seems like such a waste! there was really no story, the dialog was terrible (is anyone there? x 1000!!!), the characters were.. well, they really lacked any kind of personality... the effects were terrible.. and whats up with these long artsy shots of scared people running around doing nothing.. with extreme closeups of eyes and stuff? we were sitting the whole movie waiting for something... anything to happen... but no... ""oh, here comes the nymphs! great! oh.. they're kissing... again... and now for the violence! ok... nothing really happens... again... oh, now they run around... and the closeups of eyes... again... oh, heres tom savini! oh... he died... right... ok, maybe now something cool or even interesting will happen.. no.. oh! cool! a severed head! the end... oh crap.."" and finally, since i'm so full of myself.. i'll tell you this! give me a van, six actors, a weird looking house, tom savini, a couple of naked girls with fangs and buckets of blood and i could make the coolest movie you've ever seen... i've made movies with zero budget in two days that has better effects, better acting and a better script than this... what is this johannes guy doing?? making cool movies is easy!it could have been so great... i'm really upset!!"	1
"i thought that the nadir of horror film making had been reached with ""book of shadows"", i was wrong. this film makes that look like ""the magnficiant ambersons"" compared to this piece of shameless, unexpurgated fecal matter that has the audacity to call itself a movie. i'd write more but i'm still to angry that i was idiot enough to spend £3 renting it, bobbins.<br /><br />and were these people english? and where is the forest> i have lived in the uk two thirds of my life and as far as i know there are no dark uncharted woodlands in the midlands. the whole bally thing looked like a national trust conifer plantation. those angels looked like anorexic pornstars (turned most of them were, did my research). i did however like the bit when judd got ripped in pieces.<br /><br />p.s i love and admire tom savini but he cannot act"	1
booted out of heaven, a gang of horny naked female angels (with big plastic fangs) have taken up residence in a spooky forest where they feed upon any hapless souls who should wander by. it's not long before a group of friends on a road trip are falling victim to the bloodthirsty babes an independent low budget horror made in the uk, forest of the damned takes an interesting premise and flushes it down the pan with some of the worst acting, effects and direction i have seen in a long time.<br /><br />director johannes roberts shows some occasional flair behind the camera  the scenes in the delapidated house are fairly tense and there are some deftly handled 'shock' moments - but for the most part the film is technically amateurish. throw in some truly awful performances from horror icons tom savini and shaun hutson, and you have one real bad movie on your hands.<br /><br />some fun may be derived from the film's sheer shoddiness, and there is loads of female nudity for the guys to savour, but most will find this a chore to sit through.	1
nathan detroit runs illegal craps games for high rollers in nyc, but the heat is on and he can't find a secure location. he bets chronic gambler sky masterson that sky can't make a prim missionary, sarah brown, go out to dinner with him. sky takes up the challenge, but both men have some surprises in store <br /><br />this is one of those expensive fifties mgm musicals in splashy colour, with big sets, loud music, larger-than-life roles and performances to match; broadway photographed for the big screen if you like that sort of thing, which i don't. my main problem with these type of movies is simply the music. i like all kinds of music, from albinoni to zz top, but broadway show tunes in swing time with never-ending pah-pah-tah-dah trumpet flourishes at the end of every fourth bar aren't my cup of tea. this was written by the tag team of frank loesser, mankiewicz, jo swerling and abe burrows (based on a couple of damon runyon stories), and while the plot is quite affable the songs are weak. blaine's two numbers for example are identical, unnecessary, don't advance the plot and grate on the ears (and are also flagrantly misogynistic if that sort of thing bothers you). there are only two memorable tunes, luck be a lady (sung by brando, not sinatra as you might expect) and sit down, you're rockin' the boat (nicely performed by kaye) but you have to sit through two hours to get to them. the movie's trump card is a young brando giving a thoughtful, laid-back performance; he also sings quite well and even dances a little, and is evenly matched with the always interesting simmons. the sequence where the two of them escape to havana for the night is a welcome respite from all the noise, bustle and vowel-murdering of noo yawk. fans of musicals may dig this, but in my view a musical has to do something more than just film the stage show.	1
oh god where to begin......bad acting....characters you just don't care about... are they american or british... they seem to think they are in america, because where else is this enormous forest in the midlands...<br /><br />one big fault... they are driving all night through these woods... unless they are going around and around they'd have been in scotland come the morning.. when the whiny one knocks the poor wandering woman over....<br /><br />and they're mobiles don't work.. so what do they do... split up of course, make it easier to be picked off... so three go looking for a house that might be there in the middle of nowhere and two stay behind to 'care' for the unconscious woman... so what do they do, rather than make her comfortable, cushion her head, cover her up or even move her off the blooming road they just leave her lying on the hard road while they go and make a fire 100 yrds away....and all the time they have a camper van they could put her in...<br /><br />and onto the horny angels that are supposed to have desired human kind so much that they were ejected from heaven to live amongst us...so what do they do? embark on sexual relations with any men they encounter?.........no they bite huge chunks out of them and rip their heads off... i think they are missing the point...<br /><br />these are not gorgeous sexually deprived former angels they are cannabalistic vampires... and as for tom savini saying how breath takingly beautiful they are....well those gals have good bodies but nothing special in the face dept. the lead role was far more pretty than these so called irresistible sirens...<br /><br />rubbish film waste of £2.30 from my local library...	1
"note to horror fans: the only horror here is when you realized you just wasted 95 minutes of your life on a movie that's so worthless it's insulting.<br /><br />i watched this because:<br /><br />the premise sounded slightly promising: it's not. it's just an excuse to use the same lame set pieces from other low-budget slasher films that weren't good either. <br /><br />the promise of naked forest nymphs sounded nice even if the movie turned out to be awful: it's not. it's so not. the amateur cinematography makes sure the ""fallen angels"" are about as sexy as the average homeless person.<br /><br />the name tom savini has a long history in the horror genre: he's the king of low-budget special effects and lower-budget acting. come to think of it, savini should have been a reason not to watch this movie. it's not that he's bad, but he's almost always in bad movies. his only good role was in from dusk till dawn, and he's been milking that at horror conventions ever since.<br /><br />but let's focus on the positive: forest of the damned is a great example of how not to make a movie. <br /><br />everything else is a negative. obviously the writer is allergic to originality. the script is terrible. that's all a given after the first 10 minutes. but the clueless pacing; the way the director treats ""plot"" and ""characterization"" as a nuisance he thinks no one cares about anyway; and the excruciatingly long and boring driving, walking, and nature sequences (no doubt added to increase the running time to make the film qualify for distribution) show a complete lack of aptitude for film and storytelling in general.<br /><br />this is another good example of the number-one way you can tell if a movie is going to be bad: if it's written and directed by the same person, expect garbage."	1
"i rented this flick for one reason tom savini, i respect his work but this was a real let down, i had horrible clichés, half of the film was naked women so called ""fallen angels"" running around trying to act scary, oh and then there was the occasional ""blair witch"" black and white motion sicken camera scenes. tom's character was really awful, horrible script. and you got to love these lines they use. ""is anyone there, who is out there, this isn't funny"" no but your acting was. i wish i could give this flick a 0! oh the names of the characters. judd, molly, ally, emilio, but they did leave out anthony, the breakfast club reunite in the forest of unforgivable acting."	1
"this movie was pretty much a waste of an hour and a half of my time. i generally like the cheap horror monster type movies, but this movie was a disappointment. the main flaw being the lack of explaining the creatures. when they entered the house and found the man he could have at lease explained them. he doesn't really say anything about them other than that they killed his parents, and unless i missed something the didn't say how he managed to escape either... not to mention the fact that it gives no clue or reason why the only survivor stays and essentially feeds the creatures after her own near death experience. it would have seemed that she would have had the opportunity to leave after the ""cross incident""."	1
the plot was very thin, although the idea of naked, sexy, man eating sirens is a good one.<br /><br />the film just seemed to meander from one meaningless scene to another with far too few nuddie/splatter/lesbian mouth licking shots in between.<br /><br />the characters were wooden and one dimensional.<br /><br />the ending made no sense.<br /><br />considering it had tom savini and shaun hutson in it, you would have expected a decent plot and decent special effects. some of the effects were quite good but there were just too few of them.<br /><br />brownie points go for occasional flashes of tits and bush, naturally, and of course the lesbian moments. i also thought that the scene with the sirens bathing in the pool under the waterfall could be viewed as an innovative take on the 'shower scene'<br /><br />the film had many of the elements that go into making a first rate horror film but they were poorly executed or used too sparsely.<br /><br />if i had been watching this alone and aged 15, i would have really enjoyed it for about 10 minutes (with 1 hand of the remote control), then lost interest suddenly and needed a pizza...	1
"well this is a typical ""straight to the toilet"" slasher film.<br /><br />long story short, a bunch of teenagers/young adults becoming stranded in the middle of creepy woods and get hacked down by naked nymphomaniac demons.<br /><br />this movie has all the basics for this slasher fromage:<br /><br />-naked women, -teens or young adults being marooned in someplace spooky, -gory death scenes, -the last survivor being a well built young woman who will always show off her midriff, but never bra less, -a creepy, crazy man who knows about the evil, -lesbian kiss scene, -sex being a killer, -no plot<br /><br />even then for a cheesy slasher film, it was really terrible. the atmosphere is totally dead. nothing, not even the sexually explicit scenes and nudity, was enough to keep the male and lesbian female audience interested. watching it felt like it was being watched with a nasty head congestion or a nasty head cold.<br /><br />give the demonic ..... 0/10."	1
forest of the damned starts out as five young friends, brother & sister emilio (richard cambridge) & ally (sophie holland) along with judd (daniel maclagan), molly (nicole petty) & andrew (david hood), set off on a week long holiday 'in the middle of nowhere', their words not mine. anyway, before they know it they're deep in a forest & emilio clumsily runs over a woman (frances da costa), along with a badly injured person to add to their problems the van they're travelling in won't start & they can't get any signals on their mobile phones. they need to find help quickly so molly & judd wander off in the hope of finding a house, as time goes by & darkness begins to fall it becomes clear that they are not alone & that there is something nasty lurking in the woods...<br /><br />this english production was written & directed by johannes roberts & having looked over several other comments & reviews both here on the imdb & across the internet forest of the damned seems to divide opinion with some liking it & other's not, personally it didn't do much for at all. the script is credited on screen to roberts but here on the imdb it lists joseph london with 'additional screenplay material' whatever that means, the film is your basic backwoods slasher type thing like the texas chainsaw massacre (1974) with your basic stranded faceless teenage victims being bumped off but uses the interesting concept of fallen angels who roam the forest & kill people for reason that are never explained to any great deal of satisfaction. then there's stephen, played by the ever fantastic tom savini, who is never given any sort of justification for what he does. is he there to get victims for the angels? if so why did he kill andrew by bashing his head in? the story is very loose, it never felt like a proper film. the character's are poor, the dialogue not much better & the lack of any significant story makes it hard to get into it or care about anything that's going on. having said that it moves along at a reasonable pace & there are a couple of decent scenes here.<br /><br />director johannes doesn't do anything special, it's not a particularly stylish or flash film to look at. there's a few decent horror scenes & the tom savini character is great whenever he's on screen (although why didn't he hear judd breaking the door down with an axe while escaping with molly?) & it's a shame when he gets killed off. there are a couple of decent gore scenes here, someone has their head bashed in, there's a decapitation, someone gets shotgun blasted, someone throat is bitten out, someones lips are bitten off & someone is ripped in half. there is also a fair amount of full frontal female nudity, not that it helps much.<br /><br />technically forest of the damned is ok, it's reasonably well made but nothing overly special or eye-catching. this was shot in england & wales & it's quite odd to see an english setting for a very american themed backwards horror. the acting is generally pretty poor save for savini who deserves to be in better than this. horror author shaun hutson has an embarrassing cameo at the end & proves he should stick to writing rather than acting.<br /><br />forest of the damned was a pretty poor horror film, it seems to have fans out there so maybe i'm missing something but it's not a film i have much fondness for. apart from one or two decent moments there's not much here to recommend.	1
"from the start this film was awful! why was it that bad?? if it isn't the naked women, not only in need of a decent plastic surgeon but also the expertise of a dentist followed by a free hand out of colgate whitening!! then it's the 'crazy' old guy at the gas station, who isn't so much crazy, but more ""i'm not sure how to act a great deal so i will stare straight ahead and look as stupid as i can while pretending to shout in robotic tones about something in the woods""!! then back to these naked nymphs in need of a cure for gingivitis.... apparently, without touching you...and this is according to the opening scene.... they can cause a nasty looking red rash on your neck, which i assumed to be a chunk of flesh missing but just looks as though it could do with some tcp to clear it right up. then you have sophie holland who plays ally, i have never seen such baaaaaad acting, she is more of a ""me me me, if i'm not having fun no-one else is, and i don't wanna do this so i won't, and i'm the meanest cow on the planet, i'm sarcastic, petty and if i don't get things my way i will sulk!"", kind of person.... reminds me more of a 6 yr old girl's attitude. i don't think it's even worth mentioning the dire camera angles that remind me of blair witch, or how low-budget the film actually was that when judd was hacking at the 'locked' door it was in fact open before he reached to unlock it from the other side!! this film is completely laughable! if it were a spoof then it would have been successful...only just though, but, as a horror film is was just plain wrong!!! i can't even being to describe everything that went t!ts up in this movie i would run out of room! although it was funny to watch andrew drip raspberry juice in his ear every time he opened his mouth while tom savini's character was completely blind to the two hiding under the table directly in his line of vision!! it was even funnier when these two thought they could escape on a god damn tractor, which as we all know is thee number one hated vehicle to get stuck behind since its so god damn slow! so is it any wonder they don't get away with it?? and how many people do you know that can slice open their wrist and then run around for hours as if nothing ever happened! no pain, no weakening from blood loss, nothing!? but the silliest part is when all of a sudden (and i mean that literally) it's one year later and molly is still wandering the woods after having escaped the nymphs, and then lo and behold, shaun hutson picks her up...of course not without a line to promote his books!! (altho admittedly he is one of my fav authors) but suddenly, and with absolutely no hint of an xplanation as to how and why... she's evil herself and lures hutson to his death, then we cut to the crazy dude from the beginning suddenly wandering round the woods with a petrol can, even after his 'dazzling' performance on why no-one should ever venture there for whatever reason...cue the nymphs stupidly slappin each other around a bit for fun while crazy pours petrol everywhere....and here endeth the film....finally! my conclusion....if you hadn't already guessed by now....absolute rubbish! there was no proper thought went into it at all, whoever was aiming the camera needed firing...and come to think of it so did 99% of the cast! if the right director, actors, and budget got behind this it could have been decent. but, once again, low-budget english horror films but the rest of the genre, the country, and the english film-making industry to shame!! (and i'm english so i'm allowed to say that)! in fact the only decent and exciting part of the movie is in the first 15-20 mins when we watch it turn from night to day over a field type area. all i kept thinking throughout this was ""jesus christ in heaven why oh why did you allow someone to make this, its absolute cow's testicles!!"" but i can't turn a film off after i've started watching it unfortunately. i had to watch from dusk til dawn afterwards just to remind myself that tom savini does have it in him to act well! if there was an option for 0/10 then believe me i woulda chose that, cuz this film isn't even worth the one point i did give it! <br /><br />but this is just my opinion, watch it and decide for yourself."	1
oh boy, where do i go with this one? herendous acting, weak plot, stupid deaths, pointless nudity...<br /><br />this isn't entertainment...this is hell.<br /><br />hell.<br /><br />don't waste your money, time, or life on this pit of evil.<br /><br />it's just...god damn is this movie awful! tom savini, why?! why would you waste your life on this crap? this movie not worth it. i'd rather snort crack and smash my head up against a wall than watch this...this sinful act again!<br /><br />please take my advice and stay the f#@k away from this elephant turd of a film. no, you know what? i shouldn't even have to call this thing a film! just stay away!	1
"i've seen a lot of movies and rarely would i ever rate a movie ""1"" but this movie was beyond terrible.<br /><br />the acting was terrible, the plot was ridiculous, the effects were unrealistic and the characters were annoying. usually when i watch scary movies i think it's dumb when the characters hears a noise in house/forest/school/etc and then yells out ""hello is anyone there?"" - but at least they're believable when they do it.. this movie couldn't even get that right.<br /><br />this is a movie that'll make other b-horror movies like venom and the fog look like academy award winning masterpieces.<br /><br />i always have an open mind while watching movies and i can only say that this movie was a complete waste of time and i write this comment so that anyone else who's thinking of watching this movie will think again. it's awful!"	1
though frank loesser's songs are some of the finest that broadway has to offer, they're bollixed by joseph l. mankiewicz' lethargic staging and uninspired presentation--when it's over it barely feels like you've watched a musical. mankiewicz doesn't seem to know how to present loesser's challenging but tuneful melodies for maximum effect: for example, one of the best numbers, the showstopping `adelaide's lament', concludes by having adelaide (vivian blaine) belt out the finale while sitting on a chaise lounge; and stubby kaye's faux-spiritual `sit down, you're rockin' the boat' has his backing choir sitting in folding chairs while he simply stands there. mankiewicz zaps all the fun out of everything by letting static scenes go on too long and his dialogue (adapted from abe burrows' stage book) has none of the wit that his films like `all about eve' have. part of the blame has to go to the leads, just about all of whom are miscast: marlon brando looks bewildered as to why he's in a musical, frank sinatra plays way too nice a guy and has none of the edge which makes him so essential (the songs are not tailored to his style) and jean simmons barely registers the way a shirley jones might. only blaine, as the lovelorn showgirl adelaide, commands our attention like a broadway pro should. the colorful art direction is by joseph wright and howard bristol created the flashy sets.	1
angels who got a little icky were banned from heaven and now reside in a british forest where they seduce and chop up teens. talk about high concept. on the plus side this little mother gives us tom savini, but since his acting range is limited to two minutes screen-time, his five minute presence seems a tad long. the angels run around the forest naked for the most part of the movie, but though they might have the body of an angel, their faces sure look like joan rivers on a bad day. mediocre acting and amateurish gore-effects don't help and the night scenes fatally recall paris hilton's most famous movie. so bad that it is really bad.	1
this film actually works from a fairly original idea - i've never seen nymphs that were thrown out of heaven in a horror movie before anyway. however, the way that it executes this idea isn't original in the slightest; we follow a bunch of kids that, for some reason decide to go on a trip into the forest. the fact that the forest is inhabited by these nymphs make it more interesting than merely another forest filled by rednecks/nutcases/zombies etc; but really, the monsters are just a variation on the common horror in the woods theme. many films of this ilk don't have a single good idea - and it would seem that this one has worn its brain cells out with just that one. the only real asset that the monsters bring to the table is the fact that they're beautiful women that the characters lust for, rather than being hideous grotesques that they want to run away from. this is good up until a point; but it soon gets boring, and the almost complete lack of any back-story surrounding the central monsters ensures that the film is never going get itself out of the 'horror trash' category.<br /><br />it's been years since the evil dead made the woodlands a prime horror location, and in spite of films like the blair witch project; it still makes for an excellent horror setting. this is one of the film's major assets, as the forest presents a good impression of the unknown - the only problem is that forest of the damned doesn't ever seem to have much up its sleeve. the death sequences show a distinct lack of imagination, and the fact that all the characters are clichéd in the extreme doesn't help, as you're more likely to be looking forward to seeing them get killed rather than hoping they can get away. the cast is made up of kids mainly, but there is a role here for tom savini; who unfortunately doesn't get to have fun in the special effects department. the only real highlight the film has where personnel are concerned comes from the nymphs themselves. the naked ladies tend to look great, and if it wasn't for them, this film would get very boring very quickly. there's nothing to recommend this film for really; but if you want a daft little horror film that harks back to the style of eighties woodland flicks, you might find some enjoyment here.	1
for the first forty minutes, empire really shapes itself up: it appears to be a strong, confident, and relatively unknown gangster flick. at the time i didn't know why, i thought it was good- but now i do. <br /><br />one of the main problems with this film is that it is purely and utterly distasteful. i don't mind films with psychos and things, to prove a point- take jackie brown, for example- but they're all so terribly shallow in this, but that is obviously thrown in for entertainment. you literally feel a knot pull in your stomach. another major problem is the protagonist. he is smug, arrogant, yet- ironically enough- not that bad. he doesn't seem tight enough to be a drug-dealing woman killer. the fact is, at the end of the day, this film is completely pretentious. not slick, not clever, just dull, and meaningless- this colossal mess should be avoided at all costs. <br /><br />* out of ***** (1 out of 5)	1
i actually intended to see this movie in the theatre. it was actually sold out. i actually went to see solaris instead, which actually was the worst movie to be released in 2002.<br /><br />victor rosa (john leguizamo), a tough, streetwise 'street pharmacist', freaks out when he sees a kid get shot, so he decides to go clean and invest all of his money with jack (peter sarsgaard). things seem to be going pretty well until jack skips town with his girlfriend trish (denise richards). this happened very late in the movie, so had they not revealed this in the preview, it might have been an interesting twist. but they did, so it's not.<br /><br />in fact, there's not a single interesting thing about this movie; everything is given away in the preview. if you saw even one preview, you saw the whole movie, so you might just want to think really hard to fill in the gaps. go to the website, download the preview, save yourself $3.99. there is not a single surprise or twist in the entire film, other than how terrible the soundtrack is.<br /><br />i hope that whoever was in charge of writing the soundtrack was fired. twice. most of it is what music would be like if the only songs allowed to be released were ricky martin and gloria estefan duets, and (i may shatter the fabric of the space-time continuum with a concept as mind-numbing as this) they both had less talent and musical ability.<br /><br />the acting is at best poor, the script is at best a crime against humanity, and denise richards is at best 67% styrofoam and 33% ziploc bag. you know things are bad when john leguizamo (he was in the pest!) upstages the rest of the cast with his acting abilities.	1
the plot was predictable, and fighting with guns gets old, but this is a definate movie to look at if you have a low iq and don't really care about real movies. i would endulge in true art movies, like 'clerks', 'something about mary', 'el mariachi', or 'la taqueria'.	1
"tedious girls-at-reform-school flick, which plays somewhat like a prison movie. chris (linda blair) is stuck in there after running away from her abusive father. once in the de facto jail, she is gang raped by her fellow female ""inmates"".<br /><br />overlong (even at 98 minutes), with an utterly pointless ending which makes the entire film seem pointless.<br /><br />15 year old linda blair does her best to avoid showing her body when unclothed, but lets a nipple shot slip during a shower scene.<br /><br />*1/2 out of ****"	1
i discovered this movie with a retailer selling oop's. and this one surely is an oop. one year after the exorcist she's back in business with this movie but what we all new was that the career of blair never broke out, she never became a mega star. that's one of the reason's many of her films are oop. she gives a good performance in this movie. it's about a reject not recognized by her parents and doesn't have any friends. played at an age of 15 playing a girl of 14, that's funny. the movie is also known for the rape scene in the showers were they stick a broomstick up her virginity. in most editions it's cut out, why, i don't know, no blood is involved, okay, blair is butt naked but nothing is shown, no t&a so nothing to offend people. but the movie is slow, extremely slow. it doesn't happy normally to me but i almost felt asleep. it's just about that 14 year old becoming a rebel against society but no blood flows, no gore no nothing. why this is categorized in horror is still a wonder to me. if you're a fan of blair, buy it if you can find it otherwise leave it as it is.	1
"i picked this one up because the music was done by hans zimmer, a customer of metasonix modular synths (made by someone dear to me). the jacket art says ""the 2003 version"".<br /><br />i give it one point for a strong female, one point for cheezy dialog and one last point for meg foster's light blue eyes, of which there are plenty of shots of.<br /><br />it was fun seeing david maccullum casually swimming (the pool has a plexiglass viewing window!), while his lady love was being chased by a psycho in greece. <br /><br />the sets were marginally impressive-that is, rich people's houses in l.a. and mendanassos (sp?), where the castle was. i found myself wondering how they were able to keep up the cleaning with all the dust blowing around. the wind wasn't fierce enough to be believable to me. i kept thinking that the animal pelts on the furniture must be nasty...etc. and realized that the film must be pretty boring if i am wondering these things when the supposed plot was unfolding. i stumbled over things like why did she light a fire, blow out the match, then throw the match into the fire?! dumb stuff like that. it was clunky at best. oh well. robert morely got to have a bit of fun with his kooky geezer character and a nice vacation out of it."	1
1st watched 12/6/2009 - 4 out of 10 (dir-walter lang): disappointing musical from a character development standpoint, in my opinion, from this much-heralded rodgers and hammerstein piece. there a couple of good songs and a decent comical portrayal, at times, of the king of siam by yul brynner -- but the movie doesn't really do a good job of presenting the situation and the settings. i can only blame the screenplay and possibly some of the acting as to why we don't fully understand the character's and their situations. i know it might be a little too much to ask of a musical meant for the enjoyment of the songs and the dancing, but even this part didn't stand out a lot for me. the basic storyline is about an english woman coming to siam to teach the children about upscale european things. we find out later that the king is actually the biggest pupil. there is a side forbidden romance between the king's newest wife, played by rita moreno(a latino as an arab--come on!!) and a former lover that causes some complications but nothing really mesmerizing added though. deborah kerr, as the main female character annie -- is ok but not that convincing either. the king learns some things because of her presence and then the movie fades away as he does. this is really a miniscule story with some songs and dancing but not that great of an experience for a viewer really.	1
*****this review may have spoilers - but that determination would be negligible in such a classic and well-known story*****<br /><br />the cinderella story ranks as my favorite fairy tale. the world will never have enough of this wonderful tale.<br /><br />the problem is that everyone wants to tell their own version of the tale. this cannot work if the story deviates or attempts to throw some interesting ideas together with some magical photography and scrumptious looking production designs with poor direction and editing.<br /><br />this cinderella story is more like an ugly duckling that never hatches or rather, is never transformed into a swan.<br /><br />all the production value that money can buy, cannot purchase good cinematic timing and dramatic development - or good acting.<br /><br />the entrance of cinderella at the ball as so poorly done, there was no drama of anticipation nor excitement of discovery.<br /><br />the writing made me very nervous, too. the prince charming was the most undesirable of memory. why would any girl want to marry a boorish, self-absorbed prince who disliked women? <br /><br />turner's turn on the stepmother role was an embarrassingly painful showing that demonstrated one-liners more than acting nuance.<br /><br />even the cinderella part held little interest or sympathy.<br /><br />perhaps only one sentence will describe this attempt: so cheaply '90's,<br /><br />what must be mentioned and mentioned in shameful excess is the glorious photography, matte work and production design. it was a pleasure to peruse the landscapes, sets and settings as the story unfolded.<br /><br />for some cinderella storytelling, go for two gems:<br /><br />1) rodgers and hammerstein's cinderella musical with lesley ann warren. even with the obvious stagey tv - 60's look to the sets, this is the best version on celluloid - bar none. an all star cast makes every effort to provide the highest entertainment. engaging, diverting and memorable writing and music. this is the classic.<br /><br />2) ever after- this drew barrymore gem maintains the historical perspective, alters the story line but not enough to derail the effective development of the salient points of this classic tale. the characters of the principals and of all of the supporting roles were written smartly and acted well.	1
"disappointing musical version of margaret landon's ""anna and the king of siam"", itself filmed in 1946 with irene dunne and rex harrison, has deborah kerr cast as a widowed schoolteacher and mother who travels from england to siam in 1862 to accept job as tutor to the king's many children--and perhaps teach the royal one a thing or two in the process! stagy picture begins well, but quickly loses energy and focus. yul brynner, reprising his stage triumph as the king, is a commanding presence, but is used--per the concocted story--as a buffoon. kerr keeps her cool dignity and fares better, despite having to lip-synch to marni nixon's vocals. perhaps having already played this part to death, brynner looks like he had nothing leftover for the screen translation except bombast. second-half, with anna and the moppets staging a musical version of ""uncle tom's cabin"" is quite ridiculous, and the rodgers and hammerstein songs are mostly lumbering. brynner won a best actor oscar, but it is feisty kerr who keeps this bauble above water. overlong, heavy, and 'old-fashioned' in the worst sense of the term. ** from ****"	1
"this is a kind of genre thing, meaning you either like the 1950s musicals or you don't. if you do, you'll love this. personally, i prefer the 1930s and most of the '40s musicals with the dancing talents of astaire and rogers, and eleanor powell, bill robinson, ruby keeler, james cagney, shirley temple and so forth but the songs of the '50s, the slower dance numbers and the soapy melodramas of the decade all turn me off.<br /><br />this film is a case-in-point. the first song was okay but the next three did nothing for me. by then, the story didn't have much appeal, either. the presence of deborah kerr is another minus. i don't think i've seen a movie she starred in that i liked, including this one, where the goody two-shoes english teacher she portrays spends half the movie threatening to leave siam. (i which she had!). <br /><br />however, divorcing myself from likes-and-dislikes, there is no denying this rogers and hammerstein production has a lot of appeal to many folks, particularly those who liked ""the sound of music"" a decade later. there are similarities in the r&h musicals. thus, if you liked the julie andrews flick, you should like this, too. <br /><br />this is a lavish production with, yes, a capital ""l."" this is the kind of big-production musicals you rarely saw after that generation. you also get the dubbed singers, unlike today, where the actress isn't able to really sing so marnie nixon comes to rescue of kerr, as she did with natalie wood in ""west side story"" and audrey hepburn in ""my fair lady."" <br /><br />yul brynner is ""king mongkut"" and is the stereotypical traditionalist, the kind filmmakers always portray in a negative way. he isn't ""progressive,"" as the left wingers like the say, but the education teacher (kerr, as ""anna leonowens"") will set him straight. secular-progressives of today always place teachers higher than people trying to cure cancer! however, yul is good in this role and even employs some comedy along with his more-bark-than-bite character. justifiably, he is the big star of this film. brynner had magnetism. even in ""the magnificent seven,"" yul was the one cowboy who mesmerized the audience.<br /><br />in summary, it's a fine movie for its day and millions of people enjoyed it. i'll leave it at that."	1
"madison is not too bad-if you like simplistic, non-offensive, ""family-friendly"" fare and, more importantly, if you know absolutely nothing about unlimited hydroplane racing. if, like me, you grew up with the sport and your heroes had names like musson, muncey, cantrell, slovak, etc., prepare to be disappointed.<br /><br />professional film critics have commented at length on the formulaic nature of the film and its penchant for utilizing every hackneyed sports cliché in the book. i needn't repeat what they've said. what i felt was sadly missing was any sense of the real excitement of unlimited hydro racing in the ""glory years"" (which many would argue were already past in 1971).<br /><br />yes, it was wonderful to see the old classic boats roaring down the course six abreast, though it was clear that the restored versions (hats off to the volunteers at the hydroplane and race boat museum) were being nursed through the scenes at reduced speed. but where was the sound? much of the thrill of the old hydros was the mind-numbing roar of six allison or rolls-merlin aircraft engines, wound up to rpm's never imagined by their designers, hitting the starting line right in front of you. you didn't hear it, you felt it. real hydro buffs know exactly what i'm talking about. there's none of that in madison. instead, every racing scene is buried under what is supposed to be a ""heroic"" musical score.<br /><br />and then there are the close-up shots of the drivers, riding smoothly and comfortably in the cockpits as if they were relaxing in the latest luxury limousines, in some cases taking time to smile evilly as they contemplate how best to thwart the poor home-town hero. or, in one particularly ridiculous shot, taking time to spot jake lloyd giving a ""rocky"" salute from a bridge pier. in reality, some unlimited drivers wore flak vests to minimize the beating they took as the boats slammed across the rock-hard water at speeds above 150 mph.<br /><br />as one reviewer so aptly put it, ""the sport deserves better than this.""<br /><br />finally, since another user brought up anachronisms, i'll add one: the establishing shot of seattle shows the kingdome and safeco field. neither existed in 1971"	1
"this version moved a little slow for my taste and i suppose i have problems with this play to begin with. but first the movie, it's a typical tv movie version of a play which means it doesn't have the flair of the original film version with william holden. what they couldn't afford to hire more than twelve people as extras? why move the movie up to 1966? so you could give the little sister a line about the vietnam war protests? why not 1963 and give her a line about the civil rights movement?<br /><br />as for the casting, some hits some misses. jay o. sanders hit the right notes for his character especially with his scenes with josh brolin. brolin on the other hand miss a lot of the notes. he's believable as an ex-bmoc jock but he doesn't have the raw sensuality of william holden. i always thought brolin looks a little bit like a gorilla to have all the women in town go ape over him (pardon the pun). gretchen moll was lovely but she seemed a little too wise for the character she played. she didn't project the innocence or ignorance that the character required. maybe it's because she and brolin were about 5 years older than the characters should be. but then again holden was ten years too old. bonnie bedelia was rather forgettable as the mother and mary steenburgen can't seem to make up her mind whether she was playing blanche dubois or katharine from ""the taming of the shrew"".<br /><br />as for mr. inge's play, i always felt that stories like this of a young woman choosing passion over practicality always needed an epilogue. ""the twilight zone"" i believe offer a likely epilogue with the episode, ""spur of the moment"" where a young diana hyland was being chased by a bitter older diana hyland, because the younger diana hyland chose to run off with a guy similar to hal carter."	1
perhaps it's because i am so in love with the william holden - kim novak version, or because i'm not a gen-x'er, but this was absolutely the worst remake i have ever seen. without the original's soundtrack, it just seemed like another typical tv movie...yes, about as bland as kraft cheese.	1
<br /><br />according to reviewers, the year is 1955 and the players are 20 year-old college kids about to enter grad school. jolly joke!<br /><br />1955? the synthesizer keyboard was not invented yet, but there it is on the bandstand. the ford pony car was not invented yet, but there it is playing oldies music. the synthesizer appeared to be a model from the mid 1970's. the pony car at best is from the mid 1960's.<br /><br />20 year-old college kids? josh brolin had seen 32 birthdays when this made-for-tv movie was produced.<br /><br />the plot is so predictable that viewers have plenty of spare time to think of all the errors appearing upon their tv's.	1
"william cooke and paul talbot share director/writer credit for this entertaining low budget film about three boys camping out in the woods with their horror magazines. feet propped up by the fire and schoolboy banter back and forth...and a scroungy town tramp named ralph(gunnar hansen...of leatherface fame)wanders over and trades four tales of gore in return for food and the warmth of the fire.<br /><br />one tale is the old retread of ""the hook"", two teens on lover's lane attacked by a demented killer with a hook for a hand. another story has a couple of tokers needing to score some weed. they stumble upon a guy that knows a guy that has some great s#@t. as they smoke a couple of bags full their skin begins to turn gray and green before it bubbles up and falls off. one of the better stories is about an unhappy man returning home for christmas, who can't wait for his mother to drop dead and enjoys telling his nephew and niece about satan claus. the fourth campfire tale is of a greedy sailor that washes ashore upset about an empty treasure chest and ends up being chased out to sea by zombies.<br /><br />without a big budget for special effects, campfire tales gets the point across and really could have been a lot worse. a bit corny, but fun to watch except for maybe the sailor tale. the acting is understandably not award worthy. cast members include: tres holton, courtney ballard, h. ray york, johnny tamblyn, walter kaufmann, kevin draine, david avin and paul kaufmann."	1
"well, what can you say about a barbara cartland adaptation?<br /><br />there are some amazing actors in this (oliver reed, sarah miles, christopher plummer) but they clearly are clocking up the money.<br /><br />lysette anthony and marcus gilbert have appeared in two other cartland epics - anthony with hugh grant (who looks suitably embarrassed) and gilbert with helena bonham carter.<br /><br />if you really want to see a ""watchable"" adaptation of cartland, the bonham carter one is the one to go for (""a hazard of hearts"" - what a title!!). gilbert is the weak link in that, but bonham carter is suitably beautiful and of course can actually act, and the rest of the cast play it to the hilt with tongues firmly in cheek (edward fox & diana rigg)"	1
"the first power (1990) was a terrible film that came out during the late 80's/ early 90's era of cheaply made horror films. i found this movie very boring but extremely hilarious in some parts. this movie lacks so much sense and credibility that it ain't even funny. the swift justice system in this film makes texas look weak by comparison. lou diamond phillips is in way over his head with this role (he plays a hard-boiled cop) and tracey griffith (melanie's more attractive sister) plays a psychic. don't waste your time with this one because it's bad. what a minute, i take it back. this movie makes a great party film. check out the switchblade crucifix packing nun, she has the nicest legs i've ever seen on a nun that wasn't in a jesus franco nunsploitation flick. yeow!<br /><br />this marked an end of an era for l.d.p. his star was tarnished and he couldn't draw flies to a dung heap. it was d.t.v. for him until his ""ressurection"" a few years later.<br /><br />not recommended unless you're desperate."	1
"people tried to make me believe that the premise of this rubbishy supernatural horror/thriller was inspired by the actual last words spoken by an authentic serial killer (whose name escapes me at the moment). whilst awaiting his execution in the electric chair, he claimed that his soul would return to life and continue to go on a never-ending murder spree. it's not a highly original idea to revolve a horror film on, by the way. other low-budget turkeys implemented the exact same basic premise, like ""house 3"", ""shocker"" and ""ghost in the machine"". anyway, ""the first power"" (a.k.a ""pentagram"") isn't a completely terrible effort, but the script overly reverts to clichés and lacks genuine thrills. the film starts off as an okay, albeit mundane serial killer flick in which obsessive cop-hero lou diamond philips pursues a maniac who carves bloody pentagrams into the chests of his victims. he receives unexpected help from a spiritual medium, played by the gorgeous and underrated tracy griffith. she leads him to the killer but also begs not to execute him, as that would result in an even bigger catastrophe! thanks to tess' helpful hints, detective logan quickly captures the killer and celebrates his death penalty, but patrick channing made a pact with satan himself and returns to the rotten streets of california to do some more killing. ""the first power"" gets pretty bad once the murderer reincarnates as a vengeful spirit. instead of using his newly gained satanic powers to wipe out the entire world (that's what i would do in his position), channing simply prefers to play cat and mouse games with his nemesis the copper. he annoyingly calls him ""buddy-boy"" all the time and possesses the bodies of logan's friends and colleagues in order to trick him. even though never really boring or poorly realized, it's a very weak film to endure, mostly because you constantly get the feeling of déjà-vu. writer/director robert resnikoff shamelessly uses every dreadful cliché (the killer got sexually abused as a child) and even the players' lines can easily be predicted. as soon as griffith explains she's able to predict the future, you just know that, somewhere at some point in the film, she's going to say the ridiculously overused line ""i tell people who to live their lives, but my own life is a mess"". yawn. lou diamond philips' performance is adequate enough, but it's rather difficult to take that youthful rebel of ""la bamba"" and ""stand and deliver"" serious as a tough copper. there also are decent supportive roles for mykelti williamson (""forrest gump""), carmen argenziano (""when a stranger calls"") and b-movie horror legend david gale (""re-animator"") appears in a minuscule cameo at the very beginning of the film."	1
"patrick channing (jeff kober) is a disciple of satan / serial killer who possesses the ""first power"": even after being captured by detective russell logan (lou diamond phillips) and executed in the gas chamber, he is able to move his spirit from body to body and continue to murder at will. with the help of attractive psychic tess seaton (tracy griffith, melanie g.'s half-sister) he attempts to stop channing.<br /><br />this concept probably had some possibilities, i think, but ultimately ""the first power"" suffers from routine scripting and film-making. this is nothing we haven't seen before, sometimes done better. there is nothing about this movie to distinguish it from other supernatural horror thrillers. more to the point, it's not very thrilling and it certainly isn't scary. phillips is a hard sell as a tough-as-nails, cynical cop stereotype, and griffith doesn't seem to be trying very hard; best cast member is probably the distinctively featured kober, doing his best to be supremely creepy.<br /><br />the climax is rather silly and the ending very weak.<br /><br />not really even acceptable enough to rate as an average film of its kind, therefore:<br /><br />4/10"	1
"i jotted down a few notes here on the first power, lou lambada diamond phillips' 1990 satanic serial killer yuppie hell-fest ...<br /><br />1) lou diamond phillips was recently indicted for beating up his wife and may serve time in prison. i only hope that he can find armani prison wear to go off in style with: one of the guilty pleasures of this movie is seeing his police detective clad in $4500 designer overcoats, a $7300 designer silk suit, and seeing his $3500/month los angeles bachelor pad loft with interior design by mies van der roeh.<br /><br />2) leading lady tracey phillips has gorgeous porcelain skin, flowing red hair that always seems styled even when mussed, and amazing breasts that are hi-lighted in the 2nd half of the film by a designer silk pullover that sadly remains in place over her torso even when she was being prepared to be sacrificed to satan. at least back in the 1970's our demonic killers undressed their victims before doing away with them, though there is something to be said for leaving a bit to the imagination. by the final 10 minutes of the movie all i could think about is what her breasts probably would look like.<br /><br />3) professional psychics living in los angeles can afford $4 million dollar condos on mullholland drive overlooking los angeles with a view that would make brad pitt decide that he was roughing it. as a matter of fact the condominium used in this film looks exactly like the same one seen in david lynch's mullholland dr., which at least had the good sense to make it's condo resident a successful movie director. the only professional psychics i have encountered outside of this movie are all currently serving prison sentences for wire fraud.<br /><br />4) i forget his name but the villain in this movie is wonderful, and his ""how's it going', buddy boy?"" line could be the best overlooked movie phrase since ""thanks for the ride, lady!!"" from creepshow 2.<br /><br />5) underneath major metropolitan cities there are huge vats of simmering acid that will explode into huge fireballs if someone throws a lit zippo lighter into them, which is why major public waterworks plants all have no smoking signs plastered all over them even though the idea of smoking around water being dangerous is of course preposterous. and since zippo lighters need to be manually filled with lighter fluid that can often leak out and be absorbed by ones clothing, the idea of a carrying one in the pocket of your $7300 gucci silk suit strikes me as being much more dangerous.<br /><br />6) the stunts in this movie are impressive to say the least, and one of the fun things about watching it is remaining yourself that you are not viewing computer aided special effects but actual stuntpeople risking life and limb to contribute to a movie that earned nearly universal bomb ratings from critics when released.<br /><br />7) movie satanists always amaze me: here is a guy who has tapped into some luciferian bid for power, and yet instead of using it to do something useful like making himself rich or causing fashion models to engage in free form sex with him, he instead possesses bag ladies and have them levitate outside of people's apartments. speaking of which here is a guy who is indestructible, can fly, and is able to put his being inside of other people's bodies -- and yet he obliges star lou diamond phillips with an ordinary fistfight in the film's conclusion, yet does not have the good sense to inhabit arnold schwartzeneggar or apollo creed to ensure that he wins.<br /><br />and on and on ... to be watched in the company of wise-cracking friends while consuming beer. you'll have fun so long as you steadfastly refuse to take it seriously.<br /><br />4/10"	1
detective russell logan(lou diamond phillips)has a major problem on his hands. the serial killer, patrick channing(jeff kober), for whom psychic extraordinaire tess(tracy griffith)helped him capture, has been resurrected with the first power(..given to him by satan after his execution in the gas chamber)and can possess the bodies of the weak. somehow, russell, who joins forces with tess(..who has an understanding of what they are up against), will have to stop channing or many women will continue to die at his bloody hands. they will seek help from sister marguerite(elizabeth arlen)who has tried to inform her superiors in the catholic church of the first power, but has been denied access to a weapon that can stop channing..a cross with a blade that can penetrate the heart of channing ridding the world of his evil. she'll take it anyway and lend a helping hand to russell, who'll need all the help he can get when channing kidnaps tess preparing her for some sort of satanic ritual/ceremony.<br /><br />in the film, mykelti williamson, always a reliable welcome supporting actor, gets the partner of russell role..so you know what will happen to him. as in films of this type, everyone around russell is dying, but when he attempts to kill channing, he's merely murdering the weak host of some other poor soul he possesses.<br /><br />pure occult rubbish..stupid from the gate to the finish line. phillips and griffith try, i'll give them that, but in a flick like this they don't stand a chance. kober, who is normally often always effective as the heavy, is really handed nothing more than a goofy villain who leaps in the air and tosses rotten quips.	1
the only thing that the first power really has going for it is that it affords jeff kober an opportunity to play one of his lovely variety of psychotic villains that he's done so well in the last 25 years. kober is a worthy successor to lyle bettger who specialized in those parts back in the fifties.<br /><br />but it's not enough, the first power is a souped up slasher flick that has lou diamond phillips wasted as an lapd detective who has a specialty in catching serial killers. kober is his latest catch, but kober's in league with a lower power and they're going to team up and make lou's life miserable for him. even after kober is given the gas chamber, his spirit comes back in all kinds of guises.<br /><br />mykelti williamson is on hand as lou's partner who meets a nasty end involving a demon possessed horse and tracy griffith as a psychic and elizabeth arlen as a nun with insights are around to help lou. will he succeed in battling forces from beyond?<br /><br />by the time the film ends, you no longer care. lou really got trapped in a turkey. maybe the devil made him do this film.	1
"when childhood memory tells you this was a scary movie; it's touch and go whether you should revisit it. anyway, i remembered a scary scene involving a homeless person and a cool villain played by jeff kober.<br /><br />""the first power"" is not a very good movie, sad to say. it's chock full of those cop clichés and a very poor script with holes a truck could drive through (along with countless convenient ""twists"" that help the story run along). lou diamond phillips is the over-confident bad ass cop who sends baddie serial killer kober to the gas chamber only to find out he was a minion of satan himself and now has the power of resurrection along with the power of possessing every weak minded person who he comes across. through in the mix a very poorly realized psychic who helps with the case.<br /><br />ahhh, this is trash. but enjoyable as such, especially if you have fond memories of it. it scared me as a kid and that scene with the homeless person is still pretty good. as for any kind of logic here; forget it, just about every scenario is thrown in for good measure and you end up with a cross between a steven segal action flick and a 70's demonic flick. and who on earth thought it was a good idea to cast lou diamond phillips in the lead here? needless to say he's not convincing at all but he tries his best and i've never had the problem with the guy so many reviewers here seem to have. as for tracy griffith as the psychic, the less said the better. but kober is pretty good as the killer; always liked that actor.<br /><br />""the first power"" may be just what the doctor ordered after a hard day's work and a ""brain switch-off"" is needed. beer will most likely enhance the viewing experience and i'll definitely have loads of it the next time i give this movie a spin. all in all; not a good flick but a somewhat guilty pleasure for nostalgic fans who were easily scared as kids. ""see you around, buddy boy""!"	1
an annoying experience. improvised dialogue, handheld cameras for no effect, directionless plot, contrived romance, ick! to the whole mess. ron silver was the only real actor. gretta sacchi was terrible! henry jaglom did better with eating which suited his style much more.	1
<br /><br />i recently viewed this atrocity in my film program, and i thought it was awful, as i said in my tagline, it was pretentious, trite, petty and phenomenally self-important.<br /><br />i consider myself a fan of film, and all the things that film has to offer. if i want to watch a documentary on the cannes festival, i will watch a&e....and they would probably be alot more objective about it.<br /><br />i dont recommend it, period.<br /><br />	1
i don't remember a movie where i have cared less about where the characters have come from, what happens to them or where they are going. i realize that hollywood's greatest pastime is navel-gazing, but these people are either too despicable or too boring to take up time with. for what it's worth, though, the discussion that followed the showing, under the auspices of the key sunday cinema series, did make allowance that possibly the three women did show some redeeming characteristics. i disagree.	1
"awful! awful! awful! no, i didn't like it. it was obvious what the intent of the film was: to track the wheeling and dealing of the ""movers and shakers"" who produce a film. in some cases, these are people who represent themselves as other than what they are. i didn't need a film to tell me how shallow some of the people in the film industry are. i suppose i'm at fault really because i expected something like ""roman holiday"".<br /><br />i'm not a movie-maker nor do i take film classes but it appeared to me that the film consisted of a series of 'two-shots' (in the main) where the actors(!) had been supplied with a loose plot-line and they were to improvise the dialogue. henry jaglon makes the claim that he along with victoria foyt actually wrote the screenplay but the impression was that the actors, cognisant of the general direction of the film, extemporised the dialogue - and it was not always successful. such a case in point was when ron silver made some remark which really didn't flow along the line of the conversation (and i'm not going back to look for it!) and greta scacchi broke into laughter even though they were supposed to be having a serious conversation, because silver's remark was such a non sequitur. you get the impression too that one actor deliberately tries to 'wrong foot' the other actor and break his/her concentration. another instance of this is when a producer tells silver to ""bring the &*%#@#^ documents"" (3 times). silver looked literally lost for words. i have seen one other film which looked like a series of drama workshops on improvisation and that was awful too!<br /><br />the fact that jaglon was able to attract greta scacchi (no stranger to australia), ron silver, anouk ami, and maximilian schell suggests it was a 'slow news week' for them. peter bogdanovich had a 'what-the-hell-am-i-doing-here' look on his face at all times and i expected to hear him say: ""look, i'm a director and screenwriter - not an actor"" - which would have been unnecessary to state! faye dunaway seemed more interested in promoting her son, liam. apart from the jerky delivery of the dialogue, the hand-held camera became irritating even if it was for verisimilitude - as i suspect the ""natural"" dialogue was - and the interest in the principals became subsumed to the interest in the various youths walking along the strand trying to insinuate themselves into shot. that at least approached cinema verite. so that, along with the irritating french singing during which i used the mute button, made for a generally disappointing 90-odd minutes.<br /><br />i think we should avoid apotheosising films such as this. trying to see value in the film where it has little credit in order to substantiate a perceived transcendental level to it is misguided. there was really nothing avant-garde about it. it didn't come across as a work of art and yet it wasn't a documentary either. i know, it was a mocumentary but the real test is whether it is entertaining. i was bored out of my skull! it did have one redeeming feature: it pronounced 'cannes' correctly so i gave it 3/10."	1
"movie industry is tricky business - because decisions have to be made and everyone involved has a private life, too. that's the very original thesis of this feeble attempt at making an 'insightful' film about film. and indeed, no better proof of the industry's trickiness than seeing anouk aimée and maximilian schell trapped in this inanity. the insight consists of talking heads rattle off bullshit like ""should i make a studio movie that pays a lot or should i make an indie item and stay true to my artistic self?"" ""do the latter, please."" or: ""our relationship is not only professional, it's private as well. it's a rather complex situation to handle, isn't it?"" ""yes, it is, my dear."" between the insipid dialogs one gets glimpses of palm trees, hotel lobbies and american movie posters (no sign of non-american film presence on the croisette). recurrent slumber sessions are inevitable, making the 100 minutes of the film feel like ages. jenny gabrielle is spectacularly unconvincing in justifying her own presence in the frame."	1
"rural family drama--with perhaps a nod to ""ordinary people""--concerns a young boy who withdraws into himself after fatally wounding his older brother in a shooting mishap. despite downbeat subject matter (given mercilessly glum treatment by director christopher cain), there are some dynamics in this sad story worth exploring. unfortunately, the isolated farming atmosphere and the reluctance of the adult characters to take charge of the situation render the film a stultifying experience. what with robert duvall, glenn close, and wilford brimley in the cast, the movie is nearly a small-scaled reunion of ""the natural"". too bad this project didn't get the necessary talent behind the camera to really eke out a gripping, memorable picture. *1/2 from ****"	1
after being a big fan of the ten minute t.v episodes of 'stella street', i awaited this film with excitement and anticipation. unfortunately i was left feeling very disappointed.<br /><br />i was dismayed by the way that nearly all of the gags and one liners were directly lifted from the t.v episodes, and delivered with much less enthusiasm and comic timing, as if the actors had said them once, and couldn't be bothered to say them again. i bought my copy on dvd and felt cheated that i had parted with my hard earned cash to watch the same jokes over again.<br /><br />*spoilers* the plot of the film starts with stella street (a normal english street in surrey), gradually being populated by 'some of the most famous people from stage and screen of the last forty years', including michael caine, al pacino, jack nicholson and the rolling stones. all the celebrities in the street end up being conned out of their entire fortunes by a local fraudster, and are forced to live like tramps and common working class people. there are some nice moments, but on the whole, the writers manage to take an interesting idea and make it pretty boring. *end of spoilers*<br /><br />in the t.v episodes, all the characters are performed by john sessions and phil cornwell (including females), but in the film ronni ancona is added to the cast. i think this was a mistake. her impersonations weren't funny, and it felt like her characters were included in the story just to give her something to do.<br /><br />if you were not a fan of the episodes of stella street, you may find this film entertaining. but if you were a fan, i think you may walk away feeling a little bit cheated. 4/10	1
apparently, the mutilation man is about a guy who wanders the land performing shows of self-mutilation as a way of coping with his abusive childhood. i use the word 'apparently' because without listening to a director andy copp's commentary (which i didn't have available to me) or reading up on the film prior to watching, viewers won't have a clue what it is about.<br /><br />gorehounds and fans of extreme movies may be lured into watching the mutilation man with the promise of some harsh scenes of splatter and unsettling real-life footage, but unless they're also fond of pretentious, headache-inducing, experimental art-house cinema, they'll find this one a real chore to sit through.<br /><br />82 minutes of ugly imagery accompanied by dis-chordant sound, terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue, this mind-numbingly awful drivel is the perfect way to test one's sanity: if you've still got all your marbles, you'll switch this rubbish off and watch something decent instead (i watched the whole thing, but am well aware that i'm completely barking!).	1
this piece of filth is virtually impossible to follow. the sound is crap the picture quality goes from bad to worse to good to bad again! things happen for no apparent reason characters appear and disappear. was the director suffering from a massive brain injury during its production?<br /><br />poor film making aside, the story is vile just sick evil sh*t if you like rape, murder and self harm this is right up your alley. and if simulated scenes of murder are not enough you can enjoy clips of actual people being executed. i watched almost all of it but had to turn off after i seen someones brains blown out. never before have i seen a film that left me feeling so ashamed and dirty.	1
"i bought this movie for 1 euro, not knowing what it was all about. i thought ""hmmm, a movie named mutilation man must be if not very funny at least filled with gore"". it wasn't funny alright. it was disturbing. very disturbing. and i don't mind disturbing movies but this one just didn't mean anything, except that child abuse is not a good thing to do. hmmm... the quality of the images were terrible. the acting...there was no acting. just some fcked-up fcker mutilating himself for over 90 minutes. this is probably material for sicko's jurking off on extreme gore.<br /><br />don't watch this. it's not worth your time. its just awful. i wish i never bought this.<br /><br />they should mutilate the guy who made this"	1
"an avent-garde nightmarish, extremely low-budget ""film"" that has delusions of grandeur. hard to sit through. i get the message that child abuse is wrong. wow big revelation. i had no clue it was wrong before viewing this. yes that's sarcasm. don't watch this ""film"" if you're offended by nudity of either the male or female gender. don't watch it if you're the least bit squeamish. don't watch it if you care about acting. on second thought just don't watch it period.<br /><br />my grade: d-<br /><br />dvd extras:making the movie , the premiere,interview with kristie bowersock, deleted scenes, movie stills, director's commentary, 2 versions of the teaser trailer, music video by the azoic, & a classroom video experiment"	1
"first of all: i love good splattermovies and am not afraid to get in touch with art, but this zero-budget-flick is none of it! the picture-quality is so damned low, the soundtrack the most annoying one i ever (!!!!)heard, and as for the fx... well the super-low quality makes some of them look not as bad as they would in a real movie (what this junk here isn't). no concept, a wafer-thin storyline, primitive acting and rare dialog - i think i counted about 10 sentences in the whole movie, each one repeated about 20 times... same for a lot of film-sequences (may be an indication for which kind of audience this crap was made!!!) the story seems to be that a young boy had to watch his father rape and kill his mother, got psychological damaged and as an adult goes touring, performing a show of self-mutilation. so far, so good... but for these pseudo-art-idiot-directors, this plot is just a line to put cheap produced shock scenes in a row which neither have a message nor make any sense (freshly taken-out bowels are thrown on a naked, bound woman in an earth-hole... why?? and why is that the only time you see both woman and thrower in the whole bloody ""movie"")??? disturbing? yes!! sick? yes!! necessary? no! artistically? no!!!!! everyone mistaking this cheap gore-show for art should as soon as possible visit his psychiatrist or should watch pink floyd's ""the wall"" to see how a similar topic can be worked out in an artful way... i hope this was your first and last (!!!!!!!!) movie, andrew cobb... !!!! and all you gore-heads out there, remember: not everything that looks cheap and makes obviously no sense at all is automatically ""art""..."	1
"this is a good example of how not to make a film.<br /><br />there is very little meaningful dialog, no context for the events, and constant cuts between seemingly unrelated scenes. the result is a confused, clueless viewer; the plot is absolutely impossible to follow and the ideas presented are meaningless without listening to the director's commentary.<br /><br />this movie has a lot to do with human atrocity and tries to show how wrong it is, with an emphasis on child abuse. it includes some stock footage of real, horrible acts of violence, including war time executions. although it works in the context of the movie, i feel that the ideas behind the movie could have been presented without resorting to such extreme content. this film is absolutely not for the weak stomached or the easily offended, and should not under any circumstances be shown to minors.<br /><br />the climax is anti-climactic compared to the content of the rest of the movie. if you're not listening to the commentary while it happens you will probably miss it.<br /><br />the director's commentary was a one-shot, ""sit the guy down and let him talk, no cuts"" type of commentary. while this isn't necessarily bad, the director ends up rambling a lot and often spends minutes at a time complaining about his college, filming conditions, co producers, bad film, and a dozen other things. the constant negativity detracts from what otherwise is an essential tool for understanding the movie.<br /><br />the movie was shot many years ago on 16mm and super8 film over a period of four years on an extremely low budget. because of this, the video and audio quality is poor. that alone does not make it a bad movie, but it does make a bad movie worse."	1
it's a hideous little production, apt to give one nightmares as well as headaches. it's an unsightly blend of live action and ugly stop-motion animation. it's weird, but it's not the kind of fun, weird trip anyone optimistic might expect. it's the cold, inhuman, unfriendly, sickening, even creepy kind of weird. there is absolutely no reason to watch this movie. after all, disney did a fantastic job with the same source material. and cosgrove-hall did far more attractive things with stop-motion.<br /><br />interestingly, this is a french production. as such, it re-enforces the stereotype that the french have no concept of scary.	1
'i don't understand. none of this makes any sense!', exclaims one exasperated character towards the end of death smiles at murder. having just sat through this thoroughly confusing mess of a movie, i know exactly how he feels. the story, by the film's director aristide massacessi (good old joe d'amato using his real name for a change), is a clumsy mix of the supernatural, murder/mystery, and pretentious arty rubbish, the likes of which will probably appeal to those who admire trippy 70s garbage such as jess franco's more bizarre efforts, but which had me struggling to remain conscious.<br /><br />opening with a hunchback mourning the death of his beautiful sister (with whom he had been having an incestuous affair, before eventually losing her to a dashing doctor), death smiles at murder soon becomes very confusing when the very same woman (played by ewa aulin, who stars in the equally strange 'death laid an egg') is seen alive and kicking, the sole survivor of a coach accident that occurs outside the estate of walter and eva von ravensbrück. after being invited to stay and recuperate in their home, where she is tended to by creepy dr. sturges (klaus kinski in a throwaway role), the comely lass begins love affairs with both mr. and mrs. ravensbrück (meaning that viewers are treated to some brief but welcome scenes of nookie and lesbian lovin').<br /><br />'so far, so good', i thought to myself at this point, 'we've had hunchbacks, incest, some blood and guts, and gratuitous female nudity'all ingredients of a great trashy euro-horror; what follows, however, is a lame attempt by massacessi to combine giallo style killings, ghostly goings on, and even elements from edgar allan poe's 'the black cat', to tell a very silly, utterly bewildering, and ultimately extremely boring tale of revenge from beyond the grave.<br /><br />this film seems to have quite few admirers here on imdb, but given the choice, i would much rather watch one of the director's sleazier movies from later in his career; i guess incomprehensible, meandering, surreal 70s gothic horror just ain't my thing! 2.5 out of 10 (purely for the cheesy gore and nekkidness), rounded up to 3 for imdb.	1
*spoiler warning*<br /><br />first of all i rated this movie 2 out of 10.<br /><br />the idea is good, but there are too many stupid errors in the movie, failing to make it the psyching drama that it might have been. first of all she never fights alone. after an initial very strange doubt from her mother (which is not believable when the mother proves to be so supportive and loving later in the movie) the rape victim is not alone. <br /><br />she is also unbelievably naive always falling into the crew's strange traps. <br /><br />her friends are unbelievably nasty.<br /><br />the thing that i find most unbelievably is that ethan fails to control the crew when he changes his opinon. ethan is very much the leader of the crew (hey, they even say so) and people seem to think the other guy is a jerk, but when ethan changes his opinion he just doesn't manage to convince even one single person in the crew that he is right and that his former friend is wrong. everyone just simply hates him... why?? the movie provides no explanation. how did he ever become the leader?<br /><br />a funny note is that my girlfriend thought i was watching beverly hills when she came in. two actors from the same successful tv-series.... a cheap way to get viewers?	1
"a lot of other reviewers here, including many whose opinions i respect, hold this slice of european sleaze horror in high regard. personally, i didn't like it at all. its an incoherent attempt at a atmospheric period cross between sex and violence. jess franco at his best makes these kinds of films very well. unfortunately, the infamous exploitation filmmaker joe d'amato does not. d'amato's most well known films are infamous for their high gross-out quotient. this, an early film by him, doesn't have the constant disgusting scenes that his more notorious ""anthropophagous"" and ""beyond the darkness"" did. ultimately, its an incoherent film that doesn't manage to involve the viewer in any way. without the sleaze factor either, it becomes very boring. as i said, others have enjoyed this film, but i just found it to be a perfect example of incredibly lazy writing.<br /><br />there are a few pluses for the film. ewa aulin (from ""candy"") is in it, and she looks pretty hot and is often naked. however, cult film icon klaus kinski is completely wasted in a subplot with no connection to the main film. he seems bored with the role and doesn't have the manic intensity he does at his finest. the music score is nice and there are some brief moments of unintentionally funny gore. still, this is a pretentious and pointless film that manages to be incredibly boring. (3/10)"	1
"i saw this movie in its own time period, when having a baby out of wedlock not only ruined your life, but stamped your child as a bastard. in these days of 'single mothers' that may seem very far-fetched, but it was very true. and i'm not crazy about laughing at someone who is stammering, either. between these two problems i had difficulty finding this movie funny. at that time i didn't know who had directed it or what a marvelous reputation he had. i did know who betty hutton was, and she just made me nervous because she was so frenetic. i loved ""bringing up baby"", but i find this movie just embarrassing. i'm sure the punch at some church functions probably was spiked, but i was the one needing a drink after watching this again. the idea the girl would have to be drunk in order to 'get married' and get pregnant just added to the misery. an entire town could turn on you under these circumstances, so the outcome of this movie is really the funny part. of course, shoot me, i don't like ""it's a wonderful life"" either."	1
this very low budget comedy caper movie succeeds only in being low budget. dialog is dumbfoundingly stupid, chase scenes are uniformly boring, and most of the on-screen money seems to have been saved for a series of crashes and explosions in a parking lot during the film's last five minutes (a briefly glimpsed port-a-potty early in that scene is certain to wrecked and spew crap on the film's chief villain--no prop is here without a purpose). the whole film is depressingly reminiscent of those that occasionally came out of rodger corman's studio when he'd give a first time director a few bucks and a camera--but without the discipline corman would impose.	1
"time spent watching this film was time wasted. i do not dislike science fiction. i do not reject any genre per se, since good work can be done in any genre. this film, however is not good work. i cannot fault the visuals (when not involving alien makeups), and the special effects are impressive. the story was not out-and-out bad, for a trekkish comic book. but the fx visuals were obviously where all the makers' interest/attention/money went. the direction alternated between sluggish and confusing (one was not at all sure exactly who was doing what and with what and to whom at at least one crucial juncture). the ""acting"" was mostly very bad indeed. there was no basis to most of the line readings besides a hint of ""it was that way on the page and the director told me i was supposed to be mad/sad/scared/whatever. okay, so it was a sf series pilot. since when is that an excuse for correctable shoddiness in areas when should be regarded as essential to a dramatic medium. i'm astonished the pilot sold the series. or is the money also in the hands of technerds?"	1
"the real shame of ""the gathering"" is not in the bad acting, nor is it in the despicably shallow plot. the real shame is that it was far worse than the series it begun, even though it did have one main attraction: takashima. i would love to see laurel takashima in a room with susan ivanova, even for just five minutes. she has that sarcasm, that wit, that double-edged personality that is at once volatile and lovable. sadly, though, the ""babylon 5"" pilot movie has an incredibly dull story involving assassination. patricia tallman-- who never seriously returned to the series until much later-- fortunately got much better with age as lyta alexander, who here is little more than a whiny, tiresome telepath. i shall leave you with one final thought-- why is it that delenn looks like some sort of outer-space frog man (even though she is a woman)? thank heavens for the way the minbari looked later in the show."	1
you can give jms and the boys a pass on this one because they were at the beginning of their series and on a small budget, but the movie is still sub-par. dont get me wrong, b5 the series is by far the best tv series ever, but if i was an exec seeing this movie, i wouldnt have ordered the series. i dont like o'hare as an actor, the costumes are silly, and there are tons of cliches. the same can be said for most of the first season (with the exception of babylon squared and survivors); bruce immediately put a fire into the series and it went on to be an amazing spectacle. if you are a b5 fan and havent seen this movie, see it. if you arent a b5 fan, dont...you wont want to watch the series.	1
while i count myself as a fan of the babylon 5 television series, the original movie that introduced the series was a weak start. although many of the elements that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series are there, the pace of the gathering is slow, the makeup somewhat inadequate, and the plot confusing. worse, the characterization in the premiere episode is poor. although the ratings chart shows that many fans are willing to overlook these problems, i remember the gathering almost turned me off off what soon grew into a spectacular series.	1
i thought this movie seemed like a case study in how not to make a movie for the most part. since i am a filmmaker, i give it a 2 for consistency.<br /><br />the problems remain from beginning to end with the plot being extremely predictable using bits and pieces of most, if not all, previous successful war stories. the computer generated graphics were too much like viewing a video game at points and there seemed to be no attempt by the director to add some realistic quality to the story. i was interested in the budget to get an idea of what he had to work with, but did not find that information.<br /><br />it seemed like this project pushed the limits of a low budget movie too far resulting in a production that drags the viewer along with the story without their imagination being engaged. the actors weren't bad, but the plot needs more innovation.	1
"wow. i have seen some really bad movies in my time, but this one truly takes the cake. it's the worst movie i've seen in the past decade - no exaggeration.<br /><br />as a us army veteran of the war in afghanistan, i found it nearly impossible to even finish watching this ridiculous film, not because it brought back memories - far from it - but because there was absolutely no attempt at ""authenticity"" to be found anywhere in the film. not so much as the tiniest little shred. it seemed like it had been written by an 8 year-old child who got all his notions of war (and soldierly behavior) straight out of comic books. the film was made in honduras, which should have been a clue, but even that can't fully explain the atrocious production values of this cliché-ridden piece of trash.<br /><br />i could try to list all the endless technical flaws, but it would take virtually forever. from the ancient unit shoulder patches which have not been seen or worn since wwii, and the character's name tags, like ""colcollins"" (worn by the character ""colonel collins""), which was actually spelled using the reversed, mirror-image ""n"" of the russian alphabet (not the us alphabet) the list just goes on and on. the uniforms, the equipment, the plot, and most especially the behavior of the characters themselves -- every single scene was just chock-full of ridiculous flaws, inaccuracies and utterly mindless clichés.<br /><br />neither the storyline itself nor the characters were the least bit credible or believable. it was all laughably childish, in the extreme. this was obviously a movie that was meant to appeal strictly to pre-pubescent boys, and i have little doubt that even they would find this film utterly absurd.<br /><br />in short, this film has absolutely no redeeming qualities at all. it's a total waste of time. i'd strongly advise anybody reading this to pass this garbage by; it's truly not worth wasting a single moment of your time for."	1
i tried to watch this movie in a military camp during an overseas mission, and let me tell you, you'll watch anything under those circumstances. not this piece of sh*t though.<br /><br />the first five minutes set the tone by weak porn-movie quality acting, weird out-of-the-blue plot twists and unbelievable situations and behavior. it gets worse after that. this movie does not have one single saving grace, and yet it is not bad in a way that would make it funny to watch. it's just horrible. i've seen quite many movies in my life and i'm not one of those snobby know-all critics, i mean i'll enjoy most movies to some extent even if they're bad. this one... man.<br /><br />steer _well_ clear of this one, my friend.	1
"diana guzman is an angry young woman. surviving an unrelenting series of disappointments and traumas, she takes her anger out on the closest targets.<br /><br />when she sees violence transformed and focused by discipline in a rundown boxing club, she knows she's found her home. <br /><br />the film progresses from there, as diana learns the usual coming-of-age lessons alongside the skills needed for successful boxing. michelle rodriguez is very good in the role, particularly when conveying the focused rage of a young woman hemmed in on all sides and fighting against not just personal circumstances but entrenched sexism.<br /><br />the picture could use some finesse in its direction of all the young actors, who pale in comparison to the older, more experienced cast. there are too many pauses in the script, which detracts from the dramatic tension. the overall quietness of the film drains it of intensity. <br /><br />this is a good picture to see once, if only to see the power of a fully realized young woman whose femininity is complex enough to include her power. its limitations prevent it from being placed in the ""see it again and again"" category."	1
"dont let the mpaa fool you with their ""rated r for extreme violence"" there is definatly no extreme violence in this boring peice of s*t. i expected some cheap rambo 3 type action that the trailer promised, however its just boring boring nonsense with tons of lame slow mo flashbacks that make no sense. avoid!"	1
my wife is a fanatic as regards this show. that being the case i bought her seasons one through three and season four is on order. i personally think the show is one big farce the cast is equally bad. alyssa milano should have stuck to the other trash movies she made such as poison ivy, embrace of the vampire to name a few, the other female supporting cast members are equally inept in their portrayals. i've seen better special effects in the old republic pictures serials i saw as a child. i can understand why the male leads remained on the show for such short periods of time even though i don't know if it was their own choosing or not. please. please don't renew for another season as enough is enough, bob	1
"***slight spoilers***<br /><br />a hunchback 15-year-old boy kisses a very cute 15-year-old girl and eventually he has sex for the first time. after the act, he lays in the bed with her not touching her. the next day he concludes that he does not like sex much and does not want to try it again for at least a few years.<br /><br />this is seemingly a fine opening for a teleplay about a boy discovering his homosexuality, or perhaps a medical drama about a post-pubescent teen with a severe hormone deficiency.<br /><br />however, as the plot develops what emerges is a story of a 15-year-old father who is supported and encouraged by his overbearing mother.<br /><br />at one point, his mother preaches to her co-workers who are not as understanding as they might be, ""every step of the way in this, my son has been amazing... i have never been more proud of him...""<br /><br />the young father's older sister, who otherwise is cold towards her brother, begins to show pride in her sibling, ""you have been cool about this,"" as she gives him an encouraging warm hug.<br /><br />the 15-year-old father wants to be a father. he wants to be a parent.<br /><br />why not? we see the ""new"" baby a few minutes after birth -- it appears to be a healthy, happy 4-month-old infant. just as babies were born on tv in the 1960's and 1970's.<br /><br />once the young father is a parent, he has found happiness. he insists he will be the one to change the dirty diaper. we see the 15-year-old father sincerely happy holding his baby while the teen's busy=body mother is peaking over his shoulder. fade to black."	1
i had been subjected to this movie for a relationship class in my school. as figured it was nothing captivating and nothing new. though it tries to be original by focusing on the teen father instead of the mother showing the problems that the dad would go through. it had an interesting side to it but it just doesn't live up to its originality due to the fact nothing else in this movie was original. we have the main character who has the older sister who like in every other movie like this has a thing against him, we have the stay at home mother who expects too much and when he gives more she feels offended and leaves him in the dust, then we have the father who is always gone. then the girls side we have the parents who want everything and expect her to be perfect at all she does. on to the story like i said it was interesting but the lack of good acting from the entire cast and the lack of any good writing or storytelling. everything about this fell into cliché the little nerd kid in school starts studying with girl, they get together, have sex and then boom we have a little kid. perhaps it could've been better had the writing been well better and had the acting been improved i've seriously gotten more emotion out of leatherface and his chainsaw than i did out of any actor in this film and that's pretty bad seeing as the leatherface movies are crap and horridly acted. so far the only interesting teen pregnancy movie i've seen was juno. so far the comical side of this serious situation has proved more entertaining while still giving the same message. like i said the idea was original most of these films focus on the teen mother but this one chose not to instead it focuses on the drama of the father but again the originality does not save this movie from mediocrity. i really hope someone decides to either re-make this movie with a better cast and a better writer or just make another similar film because this one was wasted potential.	1
with the exception of family, this new season is worse than season one. i can't imagine what they are thinking. as a fan of horror, can tolerate a lot of gore and mindless mayhem, but this series gets worse with each outing. i can't imagine how disheartening it must be for the actors and crew to go to work each day, toiling to churn out such crap. story! is that too much to ask for? character! how can we give damn about the fate of anyone in these stories? if we are not engaged, who cares if they get carved up or whatever? almost every episode ends with mindless blood letting, going for gross out shock without any sense of revelation or conclusion or reason why we have been subjected to an hour of bloodletting. even dante's effort this season had some disturbing sexist violence and wandered off to a pointless conclusion. ironically, the production values and performances tend to be up to speed, while the content is utter crap. i have great hopes for exec producer's garris's valarie under the stairs, but we shall see.	1
"honestly,the concept behind ""masters of horror"" had something going for it. big-time horror directors that are now left aside by the industry being given a chance to direct horror again, i was all for it from the start. that is, until i watched some episodes... oh boy, it's really bad tv. not only does it seem like the directors are being given very little budgets to direct their skits, but there seems to be guidelines as well, like shooting in hd for example. to make a long story short, it's bad both for artistic and reasons financial reasons. i cannot help but compare to the ""tales from the crypt"", and the m.o.h. episodes really don't stand the comparison. tftc was good, moh is bad; according to me here are a few keys to explain it: tftc was shorter (around 25 minutes for each episode) than moh (50 minutes per episode), i believe it allowed denser screenplays, with good ideas reoccurring more often, better overview of an episode, less chances to let the plot be confusing or boring. duration might have been also the reason why the budget was better spent on tftc: directors got to have real film music composers (composers on moh are if inexistent, very bad), real actors (whereas on moh it's nothing but unknown actor after unknown actor!), real directors of photography and, it can help sometimes, real film cameras (while moh is shot on hd cameras with very wrongly chosen lens-pieces), the result of which being that the episodes of tftc looked and felt ""cinematographic"" in the sense that there was real actors being casted, ranging from michael j. fox to tim roth to kyle mclachlan to kirk douglas, but there were also film composers behind it, of the range of alan silvestri, great directors of photography like dean cundey, high-end screenplay writers, and in that sense each ""tale"" was a little movie of its own true kind. compared to tftc, the ""masters of horrors"" is quite a lame approach to tv horror. it's very hard to stand looking at it if your standards regarding cinematography are just a little above average, because it looks the same as any ugly tv serial, if not worse. it gets boring and even annoying incredibly fast, within the first 10 minutes usually. the actors are never-heard before wannabes (except for fairuza balk, robert englund, angela bettis and a few, but even there, they are the only famous actors of their episodes). the director base for moh was good in the beginning, but it's getting worst and worst with every episode: now if even the directors are unknown to the world, what remains? nothing! and it's funny how they are starting to have complete unknown directors while they haven't even had, say, stan winston, dick maas, william lustig, sam raimi, eric red, robert harmon, william friedkin, jim muro, stuart gordon, russell mulcahy... if even ""masters of horror"" cannot bring dead directors back to life, who will? maybe a rerun of tales from the crypt will."	1
some of the filmmakers who are participating in this series have made some really great films but they sure as heck are not showing much skill with this series. particularly the writing. ok, the first season was somewhat better but these new episodes they are creating just stink. i'm a huge fan of horror and in my opinion the vast majority of these episodes are total garbage. nothing new or genuinely interesting. few of them are visually creative. it's just typical fabricated hollywood crap, uninteresting, childish, poorly conceived and in some cases, flat out laughable. much like tales from the crypt the only good thing this series has been offering is great nudity! other then that this series blows hard. i get the impression sometimes that they hired a bunch of eighth-graders to write the episodes. maybe they did.	1
horror fans (i'm speaking to the over 12's, although if you're under 12 i apologise for what you might deem an insult): in short, if you appreciate having your imagination disturbed by well written, original storytelling, punctuated by unpredictable well planted scares, and delivered via convincing performances, then i can heartily recommend - avoiding these steamers - made by directors who have apparently long since past their sell by date. it's no accident that almost every episode feels as if it were made in the 1980's. not to put blame squarely on the shoulders of some of these old boys (or indeed the 80's) because where would we be without certain movies from the likes of argento, carpenter, landis, dante and barker (actually clive, wtf are you doing in there?! glad to see romero had the good sense to give it a miss as i'm sure he was asked to partake...). more perhaps we should point the finger at creator mick garris whose credentials include the logic defying and depressingly ill-advised tv remake of stanley kubrick's masterpiece 'the shining'.<br /><br />perhaps it is an indication of the state of television today. are we so starved of good tv horror that we applaud any old sloppy schlock that the networks excrete onto our sets? sadly, maybe so.<br /><br />normally i wouldn't see the point of adding a comment that doesn't argue the faults and merits of a production, i'd just rate it accordingly. however, as this series is woefully lacking in any merit (with perhaps the sole exception of the theme tune) i write this as more of a warning than a review: don't waste your time and money. if you disagree with me then it's more than likely that you haven't seen enough decent horror. perhaps the earlier films of some of these directors would be a much better place to start, but if these 'masters' of horror were being assessed on these works alone, they'd never have been allowed to graduate with even their bachelor's degree. unless of course they were studying for a degree from the university of s**t.	1
"according to imdb takashi miike's master of horror-segment, imprint, was banned in the us. so i figured i'd translate the swedish review i just wrote for it...<br /><br />it was hard to not have any sort of expectations from ichi the killer-director takashi miike's episode in the masters of horror series. and the dvd-cover of imprint did in deed look very promising.<br /><br />the story mostly takes place in a remote japanese bordello, some time during the 19th century, and it tells the tale of a journalist searching for komomo, the woman he left behind and whom he promised to return for. tired and dejected he arrives at the bordello, hoping that this will be the end of his very long journey. it turns out that one of the prostitutes, a deformed and quiet girl, know about komomo, and the desperate man makes her tell him where she is and what has happened to her since he left. the story she tells him is as deplorable as it is hard to swallow...<br /><br />the first thing that hit me about the episode was how unnatural it seemed that the japanese cast for the most part spoke fluent american-english. but i will leave it at that, it's not that big a deal. what is a big deal however is how miserable the rest of it was. miike's tale moves at such a slow pace that i couldn't help looking at my watch several times during the 63 minutes. the extended torure-scene, that takes place somewhere in the middle of the movie, felt so unmotivated - and pornographically intrusive - that not even that scene became interesting. i felt like it was violent just for the sake of violence itself - with no sense of style or purpose. the only scenes that provoked any kind of emotion out of me were the images of bloody fetuses rolling along the bottom of the swiftly flowing water...and, in all honesty, the only emotions they provoked were feelings of disgust.<br /><br />the journalist seeking the love he left behind is played by billy drago, for me most memorable as frank nitti - al capones whiteclad assassin in brian de palmas the untouchables (1987). i've always found dragos portrayal of nitti to be very icy (and i mean that in a good way), and that is probably why i was almost annoyed when i found him to be so terrible (not in a good way) in this one. his acting seems to flow between no feelings or empathy whatsoever to displays of some really bad overacting. when his character is supposed to react to the awful things komomo has been subjected to i was sitting in the sofa, twisting and turning in an attempt to escape the horrible actingjob put forth by drago. i'm grateful that most of the story is told by yuoki kudoh (memoirs of a geisha, 2005), who plays the deformed prostitute.<br /><br />the finale is probably supposed to be chocking, maybe even revolting and horrid, but i just found it to be kind of...you know... ""blah"" (and i looked at my watch again, for the umptieth time, just wishing the crappy episode would end). maybe the finale caused me to smile just a bit, but that's only because i couldn't help thinking of an episode of red dwarf, and the upside-down chins of craig charles and danny john-jules, with eyes glued on them to make them look like aliens... lucky you, if you've seen that episode and now decide to see imprint, i will forever have ruined the visuals of the ending for you.<br /><br />my first thought, when imprint finally ended, was that the only thing that made the pain of watching it worth it, was hearing the main title theme by edward shearmur (the same music i believe is used in every episode of this series), and that - if anything - is a big friggin warning, don't you think?<br /><br />one might point to the costume design, by michiko kitamura, and say that there, at least, is something not lacking in style and refinement...but there are so many other films and tv-shows that is so much better at showing off the japanese ""geisha-fashion"". this is nothing but inferior and i am disappointed. takashi miike's masters of horror-episode is boring, uninspiring and pointless. in other words; it's really, really bad!"	1
i'm sorry, i had high hopes for this movie. unfortunately, it was too long, too thin and too weak to hold my attention. when i realized the whole movie was indeed only about an older guy reliving his dream, i felt cheated. surely it could have been a device to bring us into something deeper, something more meaningful.<br /><br />so, don't buy a large drink or you'll be running to the rest room. my kids didn't enjoy it either. ah well.	1
i saw this last week after picking up the dvd cheap. i had wanted to see it for ages, finding the plot outline very intriguing. so my disappointment was great, to say the least. i thought the lead actor was very flat. this kind of part required a performance like johny depp's in the ninth gate (of which this is almost a complete rip-off), but i guess tv budgets don't always stretch to this kind of acting ability.<br /><br />i also the thought the direction was confused and dull, serving only to remind me that carpenter hasn't done a decent movie since in the mouth of madness. as for the story - well, i was disappointed there as well! there was no way it could meet my expectation i guess, but i thought the payoff and explanation was poor, and the way he finally got the film anti-climactic to say the least.<br /><br />this was written by one of the main contributors to aicn, and you can tell he does love his cinema, but i would have liked a better result from such a good initial premise.<br /><br />i took the dvd back to the store the same day!	1
"there was not one original idea in this story. themes were pulled from various sources; a few being the ninth gate, in the mouth of madness (another carpenter film), and the ring. it even went as far as featuring the same damn glowing circle from the ring and using it as the film's namesake. the soundtrack by cody carpenter was all but lifted from suspiria. hopefully no one will oppose this comment by spewing the word homage around. yes, i saw that the theater was playing argento's deep red. claiming an homage would be a bullshit cop-out. this was bottom-of-the-barrel. throwing gore and ""disturbing"" imagery into the pot does not make a good horror film. carpenter used to know that. he should fade into obscurity or acquire a time machine."	1
at first i was convinced that this was a made-for-tv movie that wasn't worthy of primetime. but after a few minutes of dumb-struck awe, i realized that there was at least comic value in the over-the-top stunts and c-movie acting. this movie would have gotten a 1 if my wife and i hadn't laughed so hard as we watched it in wonder that the actors could keep a straight face. it was like a less-funny spy version of the big hit (i laughed so much i actually bought the big hit dvd) with even-worse acting. we were disappointed that nick chose to marry elena, and not jim, after all of the hugging and high-fives. a few rum and cokes will definitely help it go down easier.	1
"i'm sorry to say this, but the acting in this film is horrible. the dialogue sounds as if they are reading their lines for the first time ever. perhaps i got the ""dress rehearsal"" version by mistake. the director over-uses slow motion during special effects perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the poor performance of the actors themselves. the story is pretty well written, and the fight sequences are actually better than i have seen in many action films. the fights seem pretty real. but all of this happens while to two leading actors time and time again miraculously survive incredible amounts of point-blank automatic weapon fire, grenades, morter rounds, and bazookas. the enemy soldiers are definitely some of the worst shots i have ever seen, especially when they have the escaping truck in their sights from about 30 yards, and every bazooka shot is wide by at least 50 feet. those bazookas need serious site calibration."	1
the only redeeming quality of this movie is that it was bad enough to be comedic. everyone in this movie looks like a porn industry drop out. i have actually seen better acting in low budget porn. i though i had actually rented some kind of gay porn after this classic scene: jim: watch your ass nick: you watch yours (together): i wont leave you behind!<br /><br />the first action sequence shows how awful the production is, but its really kind of funny: good guys have transformer weapons! in one scene, they all have fake hk mp5 sub-machine guns. next scene, ak-47 replicas! and then, to top it all off, they do some weapon swapping between scenes with a couple of m-16s!! i think they had a budget shortage for guns, not enough to go around between the good guys and bad guys. fight scenes are poorly coordinated and fake as all hell. you have to remove the pin/spoon from a grenade for it to explode on its own. you can't fire a shoulder launched missile of any kind while riding inside a helicopter. weapons that you throw away don't suddenly re-appear. when a gun is out of bullets, throwing it away is still pretty stupid. unless you have no idea how to reload them.. big slow trucks driving around in first gear make for awkward action scenes. i really cant believe movies like this are actually produced. this movie would be hilarious on nitrous oxide or maybe just drunk.	1
early, heavy, war-time propaganda short urging people to be careful with their spending practices, in effort to prevent any runaway inflation.<br /><br />using scare, guilt and patriotic jingoistic rhetoric, which was normal for the time, the government was concern that the sudden war-time production and therefore wage increase and subsequent spending practices if not checked could cause serious problems during and after the war.<br /><br />it truly is a window into the past, historically and culturally.	1
this is a well made informative film in the vein of pbs frontline. the problem is, frontline already did this piece and managed to bring l. paul bremer in to tell his side of the story. more troubling is the fact that the director of the film, charles ferguson--a former think tank wonk, was a war supporter until the occupation went south. what did he think would happen? <br /><br />the invasion of poland went really well too until it was messed up by those pesky nazis.and that is what this film feels like--an apology for occupation rather than a deconstruction of the act of war itself. <br /><br />ferguson seems to suggest that the war could have been run better--as if any war can be better.	1
"there seems to be an overwhelming response to this movie yet no one with the insight to critique its methodology, which is extremely flawed. it simply continues to propogate journalistic style analysis, which is that it plays off of the audiences lack of knowledge and prejudice in order to evoke an emotional decry and outburst of negative diatribe.<br /><br />journalism 101: tell the viewer some fact only in order to predispose them into drawing conclusions which are predictable. for instance, the idea of civil war, chaos, looting, etc were all supposedly unexpected responses to the collapse of governmental infrastructure following hussein's demise: were these not all symptomatic of an already destitute culture? doctrinal infighting as symptomatic of these veins of islam itself, rather than a failure in police force to restrain and secure? would they rather the us have declared marshall law? i'm sure the papers here would've exploded with accusations of a police state and fascist force.<br /><br />aside from the analytical idiocy of the film, it takes a few sideliners and leaves the rest out claiming ""so-and-so refused to be interviewed..."" yet the questions they would've asked are no doubt already answered by the hundred inquisitions those individuals have already received. would you, as vice president, deign to be interviewed by a first time writer/producer which was most certainly already amped to twist your words. they couldn't roll tape of condi to actually show her opinion and answer some of the logistics of the questions, perhaps they never watched her hearing.<br /><br />this is far from a neutral glimpse of the situation on the ground there. this is another biased, asinine approach by journalists - which are, by and large, unthinking herds.<br /><br />anyone wanting to comment on war ought at least have based their ideas on things a little more reliable than nbc coverage and cnn commentary. these interpretations smack of the same vitriol which simply creates a further bipartisanism of those who want to think and those who want to be told by the media what to think."	1
this movie was so bad that my i.q. went down about 40 points after seeing it. it made me wonder who could sit through the weeks it took to make it and think that it was worth it. it must of been some kind of personal favor to van damme.	1
universal soldier: the return is not the worst movie ever made. no, that honor would have to go to a film that attempted to make some sort of statement or accomplish some artistic feat but failed in a pathetic or offensive manner. however, perhaps no movie i have ever seen has tried for so little and succeeded so completely as did universal soldier: the return. <br /><br />this film is a sci-fi/action travesty that has virtually nothing to recommend it. the acting is as bad as any movie i've ever seen. the plot is terrible and predictable. the special effects are pathetic. in short, anyone even remotely connected to this film should be ashamed of themselves. us: the return makes previous van damme fare seem like groundbreaking cinematic masterpieces. some movies are so bad, they're good. believe me when i tell you that this is not one of them. i'm really not sure what else to say here. i doubt many people were considering seeing this movie if they hadn't already, but just in case: don't.	1
no fireworks despite violent action.<br /><br />science fiction films that reflect quality are scarce indeed, largely because transposal of imaginative themes from the genre to the screen too often falls short of effective execution as a result of insufficient funding or inadequate invention, and unfortunately for its producers, this work is lacking on both counts, woefully so in the case of the latter. with essentially no budget with which to operate, it is a grave mistake to attempt the depiction of such a gamut of events as those within this scenario and, in particular, special effects of space opera warfare which appear only clownish, while seeds from the scriptors' imagination lie fallow due to some of the most fatuous misunderstanding of basic scientific principles to be found. among these are frequent firing of weapons within a sealed environment, and a wayward law of gravity which enables freedom of movement of cast members while inanimate objects float weightlessly, but it is easier to accept these than it is to pretend that any of the episodes have a basis in plausibility. the plot involves an escape of life sentenced prisoners from a space station penal colony to a waste landfill upon our moon and their various attempts to obtain passage back to earth, with some few capable players present who are execrably directed by first-timer paolo mazzucato, whose production team wastes effort upon such as holographic pornography while ignoring a pressing and basic requirement for the creation of states of suspense and of impetus.<br /><br />	1
this is a worthless sequel to a great action movie. cheap looking, and worst of all, boring action scenes! the only decent thing about the movie is the last fight sequence. only 82 minutes, but it feels like it goes on forever! even die-hard van damme fans(like myself) should avoid this one!	1
we open with colonel luc deveraux (van damme), the original universal soldier and his buxom asian friend being chased down a river by what appear to be universal soldiers. they almost kill the two, then oh wait, it was just a field test. deveraux we come to find is now part of a government funded company that designs the new level of universal soldiers. why he would want to be involved in this (if you know anything about the original) is never explained and well beyond me.<br /><br />it's after this flimsy set piece that the real story gets going. the united states government has cut the universal soldier's project budget and in the process angered seth (the large artificial mainframe computer that controls the universal soldiers). naturally he won't be shut down without a fight. so that means van damme has to go around and take all the new breed of universal soldiers out. which sounds like a fun idea for an action movie and a take on a sequel, but that doesn't stop it from becoming stupid as hell. <br /><br />for instance, one of the new universal soldiers is played by bill goldberg. seems you can't go wrong casting a wrestler in an action movie. he's big, he's tough, right? wrong. van damme doesn't seem to have a problem wiping the floor with him... once ... twice ... three times. the point here lost on me. then there's the breaking of glass. a rudimentary part of any action movie, but someone involved must have a glass fetish. you have to see the fight scenes in particular. let's not talk about how nobody cuts themselves or at the very least slips. then to put the cherry on top of this train wreck, they have seth (the computer) secure a human body for himself and how appropriate it is when they make the villain black (michael jai white). nothing works better than a white good guy fighting a black bad guy it would seem. potentially offensive and just downright lame. he's no replacement for dolph, either.<br /><br />universal soldier 2 is a lousy sequel. it's loud, it's dumb and it doesn't care. the original wasn't anything poetic, but it made a simple sort of sense with a science fiction element and it entertained on a basic level. the sequel doesn't. they do however keep the running time under ninety minutes and somehow found a way to squeeze in a strip club sequence. so give credit where credit is due.	1
"i first heard of unisol 2 when i drove past a cinema when i was on holiday in america. i really did not take much notice of it until i bought the original on dvd which led me to find out about its three sequels. i subsequently started to read about the return on the imdb and asked friends what they thought of it. despite their horrific criticisms of it, i still went out of my way to see it and was on the brink of buying it until i saw it for hire on dvd. i wasn't expecting much but thought that it must have been half decent to get a theatrical release in the us, after all, how often is it that you see van damme on the big screen? well, nothing could have prepared me for this. it is so bad i almost cried. what a total waste of 80 minutes and £2.50. it is hard to explain how bad this move is. honestly. this is idiotic film making. no, it's more than idiotic. i just cannot believe how this got made. i cannot believe that someone out there has not murdered mic rogers. how stupid can people possibly be - firstly, van damme actually thinking the script and finished film was good. secondly, the fact that xander berkley, of terminator 2 and air force one status, commited himself to this film. i simply cannot believe the stupidity of this movie. it takes itself so seriously but comes across to the audience like a spoof. here is an example: jcvd's daughter (yes, luc is now a human again)- ""i want my daddy"", seth- ""so do i"". oh yeah, and some guy tries to shut down seth by pulling three huge levers with - wait for it - on and off written on them. the acting all round is like playschool acting. i'm sure mr director modelled luc's reporter girlfriend on april o'neil from the cartoon teenage mutant hero turtles - she refuses to go because she '...needs her story'. i mean come on - how many cliches can a film possibly use? please listen to me fellow imdb users - don't touch this with a barge pole. to conclude, universal soldier: the return has no relation whatsoever to the first movie. in fact, if they weren't called unisols then you would never know it was a sequel. luc is now a human again - what the hell!?! the only place in which he can access the internet is in a stripclub. all the new uni sols look like they were dragged off the street, they are that unconvincing. this is pure torture to watch, so do yourself a favour - don't torture yourself. p.s - best part of the movie: romeo jumps off a building and shouts 'oh sh*t'."	1
"the infamous ed wood ""classic"" plan 9 from outer space features an indignant alien calling the human race, ""...stupid! stupid, stupid stupid!"" i'd have to say exhibit a in that trial would probably this movie, a ridiculously silly sci-fi film.<br /><br />falling action star jean claude van damme returns to a hit role for him from the original movie, luke, a former universal soldier who now works making really good universal soldiers. while van damme was too big to reprise the role in the first two sequels, he was too small to do much of anything else by the time the fourth film in the universal soldier series came around. so, probably cursing under his breath the whole way, he kicks and grunts and scowls through ninety minutes of explosions and karate kicks. you'll find plenty of mindless violence, but i'd advise you get a coat check for your brain at the door when you start watching this thing. otherwise, you are liable to forget where you left it by the time it's over.<br /><br />luke is called into action against more universal soldiers after a really really really evil computer named seth (makes hal look like ghandi) turns all the other universal soldiers into evil, remorseless killers. of course this is what these things are programmed to do, but in this case they are killing their creators, not ""the enemy"" so that's a problem.<br /><br />i love the dumb logic of this movie. logic that believes that a supercomputer would create a body for itself that looks as ashamed as michael jai white does to be in this movie. logic that dictates that the creator of seth be a blue-haired cyber-stereotype geek who spouts cliches more regularly than old faithful does steam. logic that has a climactic karate fight feature two characters kicking each other though ten separate panes of shattering glass in the span of three minutes of screen time.<br /><br />the film also features a daughter in peril character, wrestler bill goldberg as a wrestler disguised as a universal soldier, and a romance so tacked on, i have to think the writers thought tacked on romances were actually a good thing. and when this movie ends, it ends. not a minute after a gigantic towering finale-style explosion are the credits running. no epilogue, no where are they now, no final kiss, just explosion, hug, over. even the creators want to get out of this thing as soon as possible.<br /><br />while it's no plan 9, us:tr is a silly little trifle of an action movie that would be fun at parties full of rowdy van damme fans who enjoy seeing their hero really reaching new depths. not to be seen on a serious stomach."	1
i'm sorry for jean, after having such a good original movie to be followed up by perhaps his worst movie in is career. this movie was shot down terribly by horrible acting jobs by goldbeg(romeo) and whatever that computers name was. also, some scenes may have been just a little unnesicary. truly, bad movie.	1
van damme. what else can i say? bill goldberg. there we go. now we know this movie is going to be really horrible.<br /><br />i saw the first five minutes of this movie on tbs, knowing it would be bad. but not even i thought it would be this bad. the plot is awful, van damme is getting old (finally), but unlike arnold, his movies are as well.<br /><br />forget this movie. don't see it. ever. i wouldn't even be paid to see this film.<br /><br />1/5 stars - at its heart lies a wonderful, action-packed thrill ride.<br /><br /> well, maybe not, but the marketers would sure like us to think so, wouldn't they?<br /><br />john ulmer	1
this movie was absolutly awful. i can't think of one thing good about it. the plot holes were so huge you could drive a hummer through them. the acting was soo stuningly bad that even jean claude should be ashamed, and that is saying alot!!! and dialogue, what dialogue???to think that i was a fan of the first one (i use that comment loosely, its more like a guilty pleasure, than anything else). this movie had goldberg in it for crying out loud!!!! nothing good can come of this movie. what makes this film even worse is that it is soo bad you can't even watch it with a bunch of friends to make fun of!!! this has got to be in my top five worst movies of all time. 2/10 because it is soo hard for me to give a 1.	1
this is a piece of s--t!! this looks worse than a made for t.v. movie. and i shutter to think that a sequel was even concieved and the results... war is prettier than this. jean claude van shame has done it again and he wonders why his career is where it is now. no script, no story and no time should be wasted on this. i mean that. 1 out of 10 is too high, way too high. goldberg should be jackhammered for this. van shame is no actor.	1
** here be spoilers **<br /><br />the government has continued to develop the universalsoldier program, now called unisol. the soldiers are now stronger and are able to take more damage than before. however the government is downsizing, the project endangered and the supercomputer that is in the middle of all feel threatened, so he takes steps to ensure his own safety. he activates and controls the unisols and start to run mayhem. the only one who can stop them is deveraux (van damme). <br /><br />this movie is about one thing. choreographed fighting. the story is bad, and is soon drowned in all fights. whatever happens, and wherever they go, they fight. unfortunately for this movie, it is no fun watching a fight where you know one part of it is indestructible. normally you're pretty sure the hero will win, but you still want to feel the fights are between two somewhat equal combatants. not where one is indestructible and can't lose. then the fights just become a tool to stretch time. you wait until the final fight when deveraux miraculously finds a way to beat his unbeatable foes. to further lower my opinion, a desperate and sure sign of a bad movie is how much scantily clad women there are. well, there aren't really that lot of them, because the characters are most men (there are at least one woman unisol though), but almost every woman is needlessly shown with at least just a bra once. the female leads get by with this, but we also pass through a strip-club (to use a computer no less) with much more undressed women. these moments do not give anything to the story and is just there to try to please the adolescent-minded male audience.<br /><br />so, in conclusion, boring fights. no more, no less. well, maybe less...<br /><br />2/10	1
i watched this movie last night and already i am struggling to recollect very much about it. the story is about a group of criminals who escape from a space penal colony. they fly to the moon in a space-age dustbin carrier; when there, they terrorise the dustbin men who work on the moonbase.<br /><br />it strikes me that rubbish low-budget sci-fi films often involve either desert planets or, like this movie, criminals escaping from penal colonies. why this is i have no idea. but i can say with some certainty that such films are always diabolical. this one is really no exception. it begins reasonably well with a decent credit sequence and a half-way alright dance music soundtrack. it then degenerates into a boring sci-fi thriller. so little of consequence actually happens in this movie that i am literally struggling to write a helpful review, so if you're reading this i apologise for not being able to enlighten you to the film's subtleties and nuances. for the record, i recall a tedious bunch of baddies, a tedious bunch of goodies, some nuclear warheads and a hologram of a naked woman. other than that, i'm struggling.<br /><br />if you feel you could be interested in the activities of lunar dustbin men then i would not hesitate to recommend this film. i would also recommend it to those of you who wish to send their friends to sleep and steal their wallets.	1
there's tons of good-looking women in this flick. but alas, this movie is nudity-free. grrrrrrrrrr strike one.<br /><br />ahem. one story in this film takes place in 1971. then why the hell are the main characters driving a kia sportage? hello? continuity, anyone?<br /><br />as you might know, this movie was released in stereoscopic 3d. and it is the most hideous effect i have ever seen. i'm not sure if someone botched the job on this, but there was no 3d, just double-vision blurs. i didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3d movies, hunting season and camp blood. sure, the 3d in those ones sucked too, but with them i could see a semblance of 3d effect.<br /><br />this thing is a big ball of nothing.<br /><br />and whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear-eating dame, yum! i'd like to see more of her. in movies, as well. looks like janet margolin at a young age. purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr<br /><br />	1
i'll be honest. the only reason i watched this one on tv is that it's in the imdb bottom 100. and right now, i'm wondering if the hour and a half of my life really was worth another 'check' on that same list.<br /><br />van damme is luc deveraux, who finds himself on a huge fight with the universal soldiers after the main computer pulled a 'hal' to defend itself. and yes, after all the obligate explosions, shoot-outs and chases he is the last one standing. combined with terrible acting and a bit of a boring set-up it makes sure it's place in the infamous list is just.<br /><br />only for the idiots like me who want to watch that full list. 2/10.	1
"this is the official sequel to the '92 sci-fi action thriller. in the original, van damme was among several dead vietnam war vets revived to be the perfect soldiers (unisols). in this one, it's, i guess, about a dozen years later, since van damme has a daughter about that age. now he's working with the government in a classified installation to train the latest unisols - codenamed unisol 2500, for some reason. as usual, something goes wrong: the on-site super-computer (named seth - like the snake in ""king cobra"" the same year) goes power-crazy, takes command of the unisols, and even downloads its computer brain into a new super-unisol body (jai white). we're lookin' at the next step in evolution, folks! most of van damme's fights are with one particularly mean unisol (pro wrestler goldberg) who just keeps on comin': drop him off a building - no good; run him down with a truck - no go! shoot him, burn him - forgetaboutit! much of the humor is traced to how van damme is now outmoded and out-classed(he's even going grey around the edges). but, though he takes a lickin', he keeps on kickin'! most sequels of this sort are pretty lame - pale imitations of the originals, and while this one is certainly no stroke of genius, it manages to be consistently entertaining, especially if you're a pro-wrestling fan."	1
this movie is mostly crap and the only reason this movie is worth watching is because jean-claud vam damme stars in this movie.there are some good action scenes in this movie and the best ones are at the end of the movie.<br /><br />the acting in this movie is so bad and its the worst acting i have ever seen and the 2 actors bill goldberg and michael jai white can not act at all.and this movie by far has to be one of jean-claud vam dammes worst movies he has done and if u what to watch him in one of his great movies u should watch blood sport,kickboxer or sudden death.<br /><br />over all this movie is crap/ok and my rating is 4 out of 10.	1
i tried to watch this movie twice and both times i still couldn't make it to the end credits. first time i managed to sit through the first fight sequence then lost interest. second time i managed to force myself to digest over an hours worth of shoddy acting, lame sfx and extremely poor direction. pales in comparison to the original.<br /><br />anyone ever hear about the old et atari 2600 fiasco? for those who haven't let me fill you in. it's 1982...et is one of the biggest box office smashes of all time...atari decides to release a movie tie-in game on their 2600 home console system. to cut a long and financially painful story short the game flopped big time and resulted in thousands upon thousands of atari 2600 et games to be dumped in landfills because they couldn't even give them away let alone sell them.<br /><br />what does universal soldier: the return have to do with this story? look at the 3.2 rating and figure it out for yourself.<br /><br />awful film...imdb forced me to give it a 1 out of 10 because their rating systems doesn't go as low as 0 let alone into the negatives.	1
this time the hero from the first film has become human and this time uses fist and foot combos against super universal soldiers and a computer which has gone awry and is prepared to take over the world. i'm pretty sure it was double team, which convinced everyone that jean-claude van damme was no longer credible in providing watchable action flicks. however it was this that tarnished his credibility forever. while universal soldier:the return isn't as dull as double team or the quest,it's still pretty awful indeed, with none of the style and flair of the original and no star pairing. this sequel is made simply for kids who enjoy professional wrestling. as i look back, not even the action sequences were all that exciting and therefore this movie is a worthless dud. in other words another clunker in van damme's assembly line.<br /><br />* out of 4(bad)	1
this was an atrocious waste of my time. no plot. the acting was so far below par, it should be used as an exemplar in acting classes of what not to do. it is merely a commercial rip-off of the earlier universal soldier, which also scrapes the bottom of the acting barrel. its sad that vd needs to assert his ego every few years, and sadder still that people will pay good money to sit thru it. this kind of schlock gives martial arts movies a bad name. by comparison, it makes segall, norris, and arnold look almost talented.<br /><br />perhaps vd should take the leslie nielson track and do send-ups of his genre. at least then we could be laughing with him instead of at him.	1
"after seeing the low-budget shittier versions of the ""universal soldier"" franchise, i hoped and prayed that van damme reprised his role as luc devoreaux in a second unisol movie. well, it seemed this prayer was answered, but not the way i hoped. universial soldier 2 is just intense as poetry reading at your local library. no, even that would be more intriguing . the fight sequences are top-notch, bruce lee quality, which is the only redeeming factor in this entire pathetic excuse for a motion picture. that and having former wcw tough-guy legend ""goldberg"" playing the villain. however, placing goldberg as seth's sidekick lieutenant would've been better.<br /><br />we offended me the most was the setting of the movie itself. it's like some film school students slapped it together. the plot holes are that bigger than kanye west's ego is what really did this movie in. for example: luc's daughter, hillary looks like she's at least 11-13 years old and the first movie was filmed only seven years ago. how is that possible? tell me that! the part in which luc's partner was killed off and turned into a unisol is just re-goddamn diculous! you mean to tell me that there was an experimental unisol exposed naked in the basement of the research complex at the beginning of the movie. c'mon. the director could've spent more time with this movie like the first one and sewn all the plot holes shut. but oooh nooo! <br /><br />speaking of the plot, it sucks! compared to the first movie, universal soldier 2's plot watered down and worthless. where's the gritty thrills in which a unisol goes berserk an re-enacts his last memories in a supermarket rampage thinking its desert storm or something ? this was the dawn of the millennium, you would attracted more of an audience if this had taken place in a dystopia/orwellian type of future cesspit. corny is the correct adjective to describe this sad, sad, sad sequel. <br /><br />from what i seen: double impact, under siege 2, robocop 3, and hell, even the cheap-ass/no class terminator knock-off ""class of 1999"" is more entertaining than this!"	1
"jean claude van damme tries to rescue his career by making the sequel of universal soldier. but, did that movie saved him? i think he goes to hell, after he dies. <br /><br />in the first minute, we see the inside of a facility, where you can see the bad guy of the film. scary, huh? but not as scary as the acting (details are following). <br /><br />then, we see van damme with a black girl (do not remember the name....well it doesn't matter anyway), trying to escape from some muscle-men. of course they are the new universal-soldiers. more muscels, less brain (just like the movie). after a while, van damme fights goldberg but then the ""mission"" gets aborted. it was just a test (is this movie a test for our nerves?). it turns out that van damme works for the government on the new universal soldier project (who has seen the first movie may think that this is the most unlogical thing, that yould van dammes character could do). but it is a sequel. and a ""story"" has to come up. ah, i forgot. he has a daughter. very important for the ""story"".<br /><br />well, after about 20 minutes, a super computer hears a conversation about shutting it down and quitting he project. of course the cube gets angry and activates all soldiers to kill everyone. van damme escapes from the facility but the computer sends some soldiers hunting him (it wants van damme as a soldier - because he is the best (really?)). and guess what, goldberg is one of the hunters, who was always a silly sentence for the audience before he gets asskicked. funny? yes, just like the rest of the film. <br /><br />after some ""story"", van damme tries to rescue his daughter (of his wife - the reporter in the first movie). it comes to a final show down where van damme fights the bad guy and you can see the most expensive scene of the whole movie (please see for yourself. it is just too funny to tell).<br /><br />you'll see that this movie is a waste of time.<br /><br />so do not watch it. but if you do, keep a sixpack with you!"	1
i don't think any movie of van damme's will ever beat universal soldier but u never know. this movie was good but not as good as 1st. vd returns a luc & must do battle again. he tries 2 b funny here but its maybe worth a smirk of a chuckle. vd has a kid this time from ally w., good it showed a pic of them 2. goldberg was cool, he does his famous move-forgot what its called cause i don't watch wrestling-sucks. vd & goldberg had some good fights. it was the ending like the 1st but just not that good. vd does his best move in his career, like always-the helicopter kick. even though, the final ending should've been longer. anyway, it is worth seeing but it will never top the original.	1
"ok i saw this movie to get a benchmark for bad but with this movie it's unisol's best movie now plot luc devereux is now a technical expert who is working with the government with his partner maggie, who's been through countless hours of training and combat with him, to refine and perfect the unisol program in an effort to make a new, stronger breed of soldier that is more sophisticated, intelligent, and agile. all of the new unisols, which are faster and stronger than their predecessors, are connected through an artificially intelligent computer system called seth, a self-evolving thought helix. when seth discovers that the universal soldier program is scheduled to be shut down because of budget cuts, he takes matters into his own ""hands"" to protect himself. killing those who try to shut off his power, and unleashing his platoon of super-soldiers, led by the musclebound romeo, seth spares deveraux, only because deveraux has the secret code that is needed to deactivate a built-in program that will shut seth down in a matter of hours. with the help of a hacker named squid, seth takes human form. not only must luc contend with ambitious reporter erin, who won't leave his side, but luc also must contend with general radford, who wants to take extreme measures to stop seth. seth has also kidnapped luc's injured 13-year-old daughter hillary, and is now holding her hostage. luc is the only person who can rescue hillary, because luc knows firsthand how a unisol thinks, feels, and fights. now there are problems like in any movie like did anyone find it weird how a reporter just-so-happened to be there and the soldiers can take being flattened with a truck however when vanne damme shoots them with a gun with one bullet and they die and the final fight scene was unbelievable when luc is now human and seth is 5x stronger and faster than any other unisol and luc can take a hit from him. with the final fight when luc smashes him to pieces i was really surprised that the pieces didn't melt and reform him (terminator 2). another thing that bugs me is how the hell does vanne damme get good actors to play relatives i mean in the case of vanne damme it's completely off the grid of how science fiction this movie is. the music score now that must have a mention have you ever listened to a song where you'd rather cut a blackboard with a knife well universal soldier 2 is like that. the good points are there's no dolph (hooray) and unlike the 1st one there is only one naked scene whereas in the 1st one there are many (i'm still haunted by the scenes in #1) also the actors in this have some talent whereas in the first one the casting guys were sadists (if you don't believe me look it up)"	1
"ok, so it was written in 1996, before 9/11, so you can give it a little credit for worrying about terrorists and the idea that the cia director makes a plot to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it brings doom to the world, is prescient. that's it. that's the good stuff. the acting...fair. the plot...silly. the ""twist""... unnecessary. dooooooooooom it isn't as though no one ever thought of what to do when a plane gets contaminated. don't you think bureaucrats have a manual for ""plagues"" and how to contain them? proper execution of such a plan is always a problem, as we saw after katrina. but they have a plan. it isn't to send them off to iceland and then to mauritania. and if the virus is carried in the air, why was the plane door open and the ""shooters' standing there with no protection? in fact, did it ever occur to anyone to shoot her legs? that would stop her. but not as dramatic. i'm a sucker. i always watch a movie to see the end, once i started it. but this was a waste of time, and for the most part, predictable. i saw it using a recorder so i didn't have to watch all the ads, that was a plus. it's a good example of why i watch so little network tv. rubbish."	1
the mind boggles at exactly what about universal soldier merited a sequel. since the real star, dolph lundgren, would not be able to reprise his role from the original, there is already scant reason to indulge oneself in this obvious tax write-off. bold attempts are made to fill the gap with professional wrestler bill goldberg and martial arts expert michael jai white. to their credit, they give their action sequences a good sense of excitement. bill goldberg looks like he is having the time of his life on this film, and he makes a fair stab at filling the requisite comedic villain role. for once, his role is the kind that involves repeating the same line a few times, and it does not get irritating. the problem from the audience's point of view is that neither of these gentlemen really have the sense of comic timing or minor humility that makes lundgren such a pleasure to watch in almost all of his films. and therein lies the problem. you do not go to see a van damme film because you want serious action. you go because you want comedy, however unintentional.<br /><br />unbeknownst to many people, universal soldier was followed by two direct-to-video sequels. i have only seen the first, which had production values so bad one can only wonder if it was meant to be some kind of elaborate joke. matt battaglia was so terrible in the role of luc deveraux that for once in his career, the sight of jean-claude van damme comes as a welcome relief. the film more or less completely disregards the stories of the aforementioned direct-to-video sequels, and instead begins a whole new story set an indeterminate time after the events of the original. after years of investigation and explanation, the unisol project is still going ahead, with some minor modifications. for one, the new unisols are stronger and more damage-resistant than their earlier cousins. for another, all of the unisols are now under the direction of a supercomputer called seth. in the early parts of the film, seth exists primarily as a series of abstract graphics within a glass dome.<br /><br />being that the film barely lasts more than eighty minutes, we are quickly told that funding to the military is being cut. the unisol project is on the chopping block, which essentially means that seth will be turned off. seth, somehow overhearing this conversation through means that are never really explained, decides to mobilise the unisols as an army against those seeking to shut him down. his only problem is that every so often, a code is required to be put into his system in order to prevent automatic shutdown. two individuals possess the code in question. seth kills the first in short order, and those who are familiar with the plot kit that van damme's films are constructed out of will guess within five seconds who the second happens to be. the rest of the film revolves around the unisols' attempts to get the code out of van damme without injuring him too badly. a subplot with a daughter and a reporter is woven into the film, but it adds about as much to the story as van damme does to the profession of acting.<br /><br />the film is loaded to the brim with ridiculous lines and clichés. when seth transplants his command module into the body of michael jai white, we get a speech about how the time of the humans is over. he goes on to tell his foot soldiers how fear and mortality will be humanity's weakness(es). gee, seth, you mean they will not be our strong points? all kidding aside, the short length of the film is both the film's weakness and its strength. it leaves the action without adequate setup. in the original, we are given a very thorough explanation of the unisols, how they work, and how they are brought to the state that is seen in the majority of the film. here, the writer seems to take it for granted that the viewer knows what a unisol is and how they operate. at least in the original, a moment of curiosity and wonder was created by leaving the explanation for later in the film when the hero lies in a tub of ice. here, one of the villains is shot with a gun that leaves massive holes in his uniform (and presumably his body), getting up every time without stopping for breath.<br /><br />i tend to reserve the score of one for films that are so bad that they become entertaining in a completely unintentional manner. if you can see it on the cheap, knock yourself out. this is the kind of film that makes me mourn the loss of mystery science theatre.	1
wow what a great premise for a film : set it around a film maker with writer`s block who decides to take up tango lessons . hey and what an even better idea cast the central role to a film maker who`s interested in tango. gosh i wish i had that knack for genius . yes i`m being sarcastic.<br /><br />it amazes me that these type of zero potential for making money movies are made . come on unless you`re a rabid tango fan ( i do concede they do exist judging by the comments ) or a die hard member of the sally potter fan club ( ? ) there`s nothing in this film that will make you rush off to the cinema to see it . even if you`re into tango much of the film is taken up with meaningless scenes like a house getting renovated or a man in wheelchair going along a road <br /><br />coming soon the review lesson where a failed screenwriter from scotland sits in front of a computer writing very sarcastic but highly entertaining reviews of films he`s seen . gasp in shock as theo robertson puts the boot into the latest hollywood blockbusters , weep in sympathy as he gets yet another rejection letter from a film company , fall in lust as he takes a bath and rubs soap over his well toned body . the review lesson coming soon to a cinema near you if anyone is stupid enough to fund the movie<br /><br />ps sally potter is unrelated to harry potter	1
the dancing was probably the only watchable thing about this film -- and even that was disappointing compared to some other films. my gawd!<br /><br />to me, this is the worst kind of film -- one that assumes it's a work of art because it has all the trappings of film-as-art. yes, it's beautifully photographed, but ultimately lacks the depth and tension of the dance around which the film supposedly surrounds itself. tango is a tease, it's hot, it has drama, it's audacious -- precisely what this film is not.	1
this is the worst movie i have ever seen, and i have seen quite a few movies. it is passed off as an art film, but it is really a piece of trash. it's one redeeming quality is the beautiful tango dancing, but that cannot make up for sally potter's disgustingly obvious tribute to herself. the plot of this movie is nonexistent, and i guarantee you will start laughing by the end. especially where she starts singing. it's absolutely unreal.	1
strange how less than 2 hours can seem like a lifetime when sitting through such flat, uninspiring drivel. if a story is as personal as this supposedly was to sally potter, wouldn't you expect a little passion to show through in her performance? her acting was completely detached and i felt no chemistry between sally and pablo and the tango scenes, which should have been fiery given the nature of the dance, were instead awkward and painful to watch. obviously, revealing such a personal story on film can be daunting, and as such sally potter would have been wise to let a better actor take on the task rather than let her passion fall victim to her own sheepishness.	1
dire. just dire. the script is contrived, the acting painful, and the story just drags along. it is, without a doubt, a celebration of sally potter and little else. this wouldn't be so bad, but she's the director, writer and star of the film, and so is just self-glorification. i found myself not caring about the developing romance between the principal two characters, and the ending came not a moment too soon. it has two redeeming features. first is that a lot of the shots are really quite lovely, particularly in paris, and look rather good in black and white. secondly, whether you're a fan of tango or not, the music is by and large, excellent (except where sally starts singing). watch this film at your own risk, or if you need an unintentional laugh. i am sure it appeals to someone. statistically, it has to.	1
"probably encouraged by admirers of her much-better ""orlando"", potter here delivers a vehicle for herself in the worst way: she writes, directs, stars, and actually co-writes the music, including a mawkish love song. the film strongly resembles a high school or college project by a teenager convinced that her own intimate loves and melodramatic obsessions are as fascinating to us as to her. but potter's character is as unsympathetic as the object of her romantic obsession is unlikable, and the whole film is an embarrassing display of narcissism masquerading as a celebration of the tango. perhaps if she hadn't cast herself it might have worked. she just can't act, whether playing herself or not. pretentious, over-ambitious, dull, and silly."	1
the film is severely awful and is demeaning to rape victims. on the surface, it may be a daring film about rape but if you dig beneath the surface, what lies is a not-so-positive message about rape. aishwarya the rape victim is shown to be a helpless victim who cannot cope all because she is a woman. she needs a man to help her. when the society makes jibes about her and throws comments at her, she does not stand up for herself. it is all left to anil kapoor to do all the talking while aishwarya does all the crying.<br /><br />the director (satish kaushik) went down the wrong path by portraying a rape victim as weak and submissive. what would have been more effective is portraying a strong woman who rebels against her enemies in a courageous way. the director is famous for being chauvinistic. his films are usually full of weak women but he tries to hide them in controversial roles. he needs to learn that just because the role is controversial, it does not mean that the character herself is strong.<br /><br />the most degrading scene in the film is when aishwarya 'cleans' herself after just being raped. she does it to please her father who thinks that she is now dirty. though it is commendable that shah shows the stigma against rape victims in such a stark light, what he does not show us is whether ash's father was wrong for making his daughter do such a thing. thus we are left with a confusing message about rape.<br /><br />the comedy too is not needed in a strong subject film like this. even more so, the comedy is simply not funny. ash is wooden in her role while anil kapoor does nothing but shout. the music is mediocre except for the title track, which is beautifully picturised (the only bright point of this film). sonali bendre's role is disappointing and pointless. overall, what could have been a great movie to remember ends up being an awful mish-mash that will give some viewers severe indigestion.	1
...but a lousy film. as maltin says this was christopher lee's attempt to make a serious horror film. well, it is serious...too serious! the plot is silly and slow (something about old people inhabiting the bodies of young children to achieve immortality)...the film is all talk talk talk talk talk talk talk about the same things over and over again. i actually dozed off a few times! the film is sooooo dull! the cast sleepwalks through this with the sole exceptions of peter cushing and lee...but this was probably a labor of love for both (they often complained about horror movies being too violent...well, this has no violence!). avoid at all costs...unless you have insomnia...this will put you to sleep!	1
in its depiction of a miserable milanese underclass, this film was probably quite revealing in its day. however, i get the feeling that neorealism was never really director de sica's bag, since here he decided to try and create some sort of modern fable centring around a boy that had been found in a cabbage patch by an old dear in the country. after spending most of his childhood in an orphanage, toto ends up living in a shantytown in milan. he organises the inhabitants into community action, and keeps their spirits up by swanning around with an annoyingly constant smile on his face and testing them on their times tables. that nobody tells him where to stick his times tables is beyond me, as these people have far more important things to think about, like where the next pot noodle is going to come from. anyway, de sica then uses a sublimely subtle dramatic device in order to highlight exactly why these poor sods are where they are. it's all down to capitalism of course, and in order to illustrate this, he has the miserables discover a fountain of oil on their land. brilliant! to his credit, though, by this time he has given up on making a serious film, and the capitalists appear as severe caricatures, all fur coats and cigars. they want that land, but our mathematical hero will not support such nonsense. by a bizarre stroke of luck, his old, deceased guardian from the cabbage patch days appears in the sky and gives him a magic dove. he uses it to shower gifts on his mates, who prove just as greedy as the cigar men. i reckon this film was a missed opportunity. to address the theme of poverty , as not many film-makers had done until then, and then get caught up in a fairy tale, to me seems a bit daft. how come 'great' directors get away with child-like plot turns like the ones we see here? hans christian anderson would probably have balked at the idea of having the poor folk flying off over the milan duomo and on to a higher place on broomsticks. de sica, however, is proclaimed as a genius for this. surely the fact that these people are so poor, that their faith is unswerving, and that miracles never happen to them, is enough for any story-teller to work on.<br /><br />	1
"in spite of having some exciting (and daring) sequences, nbtn just never gets going. there are exploding boats, hat pin murders, mass suicides, pathologists with body parts, and all sorts of classic mystery/horror scenes, but they're interspersed with extended periods of pure exposition. everybody in the movie looks bored. this is a shame because many of the sequences would be considered daring at the time this was filmed.<br /><br />add to this the ""too-proper"" brit characters and you feel like you've drifted into a sherlock holmes movie.<br /><br />finally, the cinematography is very ordinary. there are lots of opportunities for beautiful shots of of the countryside, or complex shots of someone being pulled into a huge bonfire, but the whole thing is unimaginative and dull.<br /><br />definitely only for lee and cushing fans."	1
"i won't add to the plot reviews, it's not very good.<br /><br />very improbable orphanage on bala.<br /><br />cushing and lee at their height.<br /><br />some nice scenery.<br /><br />good for face spotting, and i quote, ""look at the mouth, that is cassie from fools and horses"".<br /><br />otherwise, a poor example of the british film industry.<br /><br />fulton mackay was far better in fraggle rock, keith barron was better in anything else and diana dors did what she did best.<br /><br />redeeming feature? it was free to watch on the horror channel prior to its going over to subscription. i won't be subscribing on this effort."	1
"i actually have a fondness for christopher lee, but this just wasn't up to his other performances... and he was one of the better actors.<br /><br />the film does not live up to its premise. it's not that scary, it's overly melodramatic, and it draaaaaags. every time i thought, ""oh, here comes the good part"" the good part never quite arrived.<br /><br />the evil ones aren't at all convincing. most of the other characters were also lacking in depth.<br /><br />perhaps if i'd been in the proper frame of mind, i might have enjoyed some mstie-fication at this film's expense, but.... naaahhh... didn't really seem to be worth the effort. it wasn't really very good, it wasn't really very bad, it was just mediocre."	1
"three daring daughters"" is a sickly sweet, rose-colored look at divorce, remarriage, and single-parent living. obviously, social issues and economic difficulty have no place in the picture perfect life of a single parent mother who feels exhausted, takes a cruise, and then dates and marries a band conductor. even when the ""its just a movie"" phrase excuses the script from addressing real-life problems, 'daughters' suffers from too many incoherent high-note songs, children whose personalities are not based on real children and band leader hose iturbi playing himself. isn't it bizarre that any real person would star in a film in which their supposed real self gets married? <br /><br />admittedly, this movie was released in the nineteen forties. only a love for old style hollywood romance and comedy could make 'daughters' a tolerable film.	1
in an otherwise good review, loleralacartelort7890 says ""the truth is that the americans use a secret aluminum-anti-radiation-alloy. it is not that well-known. and the exact specifications are a secret. and why is it a secret: well, why should they reveal it back then?? if they where in a space race with the russians, then it would be very dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation."" this is completely incorrect. there is (and was) no ""secret"" to radiation protection in apollo. the design and construction of the apollo command module has long been publicly available. it uses a lightweight ""honeycomb"" of aluminum and stainless steel. the entire outer surface (except the windows of course) is covered with a heat shield made of a phenolic resin, thicker on the bottom that faces forward during re-entry. these materials are actually *better* at stopping the kind of radiation we have in space (charged particles) than lead, which is better suited to stopping ionizing photons like x-rays and gamma rays.<br /><br />space radiation is a definite problem for *long term* space flight because of the risk of big solar flares. but it simply wasn't a serious threat to the apollo astronauts. the command module gave them pretty good protection during their brief (1/2 hour or so) passage through the van allen belts. they all carried dosimeters so we know exactly how much radiation they each received: no more than 1.5 rem, and usually much less. of the 24 men who flew to the moon (12 of whom landed), 18 are still alive. only two have died from cancer: alan shepard (leukemia) and jack swigert (bone cancer). the rest died from heart attacks, pancreatitis (roosa), and a motorcycle accident (conrad). these are actually pretty good statistics for a group of men now in their late 70s (shepard would be 86).	1
i am a 11th grader at my high school. in my current world affairs class a kid in my class had this video and suggested we watch. so we did. i am firm believer that we went to the moon, being that my father works for nasa. even though i think this movie is the biggest piece of crap i have ever watched, the guy who created it has some serious balls. first of all did he have to show jfk getting shot? and how dare he use all those biblical quotes. the only good thing about this movie is it sparks debates, which is good b/c in my class we have weekly debates. this movie did nothing to change my mind. i think he and michael moore should be working together and make another movie. michael moore next movie could be called ""a funny thing happened on spetember 11th"" or ""a funny thing happened on the way to the white house"".	1
this documentary is founded on sponge cake as soon as you put any real evidence on it the integrity slowly sinks into a big pile of crap for example bart sibrel claims they must have had multiple lighting sources because the shadows appear to be crossing if this were the case wouldn't there be two or more shadows for each object when apollo 11 went through the van allan radiation belts they spent 30 min's there not the 90 min's claimed in the documentary and they received a dose of radiation more equivalent to that of an an x ray.<br /><br />seriously do some research learn what really happened don't let this pile of crap of a documentary mold your opinion of what really happened	1
i notice that most of the people who think this film speaks the truth were either not born before the moon landings (1969-1972), or not old enough to appreciate them. i think it is much easier to question an historic event if you did not live through it.<br /><br />i was a youngster at the time of apollo, but i was old enough to understand what was going on. the entire world followed the moon landings. our families gathered around the tv to watch the launch. newspaper headlines screamed the latest goings-on each day, from launch to landing, from moonwalks to moon liftoff, all the way to splashdown, in a multitude of languages. in school, some classes were cancelled so we could watch the main events on tv. during apollo 13 the world prayed and held its collective breath as the men limped home to an uncertain fate. you couldn't go anywhere without someone asking what the latest was. the world was truly one community. <br /><br />now with a buffer of 30-odd years after the fact, it is easy to claim fraud because worldwide enthusiasm and interest has died down. we are left with our history books, and anybody can claim that history is wrong and attempt to ""prove"" it with a bunch of lies and made-up facts while completely ignoring the preponderance of evidence showing otherwise--not to mention the proof that dwells in the souls and memories of those who lived through these wonderfully heady and fantastic days.	1
this so-called ""documentary"" tries to tell that usa faked the moon-landing. year right.<br /><br />all those who have actually studied the case knows different.<br /><br />first of all: there is definitely proof. when the astronauts was on the moon, they brought back many pounds of rock from the moon - for geological studies. these where spread around the world to hundreds of labs, who tested them. and they all concluded that they came from the same planet, not earth: because the inner isotopes of the basic elements are different from those found on earth, but similar to those calculated to be on the moon. i.e. the conspiracy theorists never studies anything: they only take the thing that fit into their theory and ignores the rest.<br /><br />another wrongful claim from them is that their was wind in the hangar where they shot the moon landing, i.e. the flag moves. there is a logical explanation: the astronaut moved it with his hand, so it moved. and what proves this: well, if the conspiracy theorists even studied the footage, they would see that the flag never moves after the astronaut have let it be, i.e. the conspiracy theorists are bad-scientists, they cant study a subject properly, or only studies it until they have what they came for, so that they can make a lie from that, and make a profit (i.e. this so-called ""documentary"").<br /><br />a claim says that it cant possible have been filmed on the moon because all the shadows come from different places, because there are different light-sources, the artificial lighting from the studio. once again the conspiracy theorists are wrong (as usual), the same would happen in an earth desert at night, with no light-sources. but i doubt that any conspiracy theorists have ever been outside their grandmothers basement for more than how many days a star treck-convention is held over.<br /><br />the conspiracy theorists are in denial, big time. they only see what they want to see. so they make up all these lies to seem important - that is a fact.	1
the only reason i didn't score this a one is that sibrel does show that he is adept at the technical aspects of making a film. it is a technically adept film.<br /><br />that having been said, this is a film based on lies and distortions that are quite easily disproven. most of the documentary is spent using propaganda techniques to bash the space program, rather than actual fact. and sibrel's ""irrefutable proof"" that the landings were faked is easily refuted if you know anything about orbital mechanics.<br /><br />i do not recommend watching this, but if you do, see it at google video for free. don't let bart sibrel profit from your curiosity.	1
when i was 16 i saw the documentary: ""a funny thing happened on the way to the moon"". i actually liked, and believed in it for a couple of years. but then i grew up, and began to think, and when i had sought more information. this is: more info from reel sources, and non-biased sources. when i started at university, not so long ago, i asked an assistant-professor in astronomy about these conspiracy theories. what he said shocked me: he said that all those theories where lies. that baffled me, i did not believe it first, but then he presented evidence for his claims. he quickly debunked most of the theories about the subject: ""humans did not go to the moon"". the most outrages claim was that the apollo-craft could not travel through the van-allen-radiation-belt, without the crew perishing from radiation. the truth is that the americans use a secret aluminum-anti-radiation-alloy. it is not that well-known. and the exact specifications are a secret. and why is it a secret: well, why should they reveal it back then?? if they where in a space race with the russians, then it would be very dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation.<br /><br />and then there is the biggest evidence of all: the moon stones. when the apollo-missions did go to the moon, they brought back many rocks from the moon, to give to geologists and similar scientists, who are documenting all things about the moon. these rocks and stones are in fact from the moon. because: the internal basic elements, which all matter consist of, are also made of special isotopes, that are different from quarry to quarry, land to land, and especially planet from planet. the isotopes of these rocks and stones have been proved, that they do not come from earth. the astronauts brought home hundreds of kilogram's of these rocks, all of them have been proved to have come from outside earth, and from the same planet. ergo: the moon-landings where not fake. nasa did go to another planet: the moon, though it is not a planet, but a satellite to a planet, a moon (duuh). these rocks have been distributed to laboratories and universities all around the world. it has been proved: humans did go to the moon - it is a fact, pronto.<br /><br />but i do not worry: most conspiracy-theorists are generally unemployed and uneducated, that is mostly why they do not know or lie about these facts. the fact remains: humans did walk on the moon.	1
the views of earth that are claimed in this film to have been faked by nasa have recently been compared with the historical weather data for the time of apollo 11, and show a good match between the cloud patterns in the video sequence and the actual rainfall records on the day.<br /><br />this would seem to undermine the entire argument put forward in the film that the ""whole earth"" picture is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft window.<br /><br />i am waiting for bart sibrel to now claim that the historical weather data has been faked by nasa, though that would no doubt involve them in also replacing every archived newspaper copy with a weather map, and the ones in private hands would still be a problem.<br /><br />ah, a response: ""trying to discredit this movie by referring to nasa weather data i'd say is a charming, but weak and gullible argument. what about the rest of the footage and proofs in the movie? a certain wise man once said something about sifting mosquitoes and swallowing camels. do you in any way feel that maybe this could apply to what you are trying to do here? :-) this movie is just packed with irrefutable evidence against the claim once made by u.s. government that the moon-missions were a success, and that man now are true masters of the universe. things are nearly never quite what they seem.. just watch the movie, and i dear say you'll see things a bit different than before.""<br /><br />first off, weather data doesn't come from nasa, it comes for met agencies around the world. second, the weather data undermines a major claim in the film. third, far from being ""packed with irrefutable evidence"", the remaining claims in the film have been thoroughly debunked. sibrel thought he had a previously secret piece of film, so he edited it and added his own interpretation. unfortunately for him, his source film is public domain, and the bits sibrel edited out contradict his claims.	1
there are so many incorrect statements in this so-called ""documentary"" that i found myself shouting at the television.<br /><br />bart sibrel might be able to produce a flashy looking dvd, but he is sadly lacking at looking at the science behind his claims.<br /><br />he relies on either being inaccurate, not telling the full story, or the old favourite ""government always lies to us"" innuendos, and people believing what is told to them and not checking on the accuracy or details behind the claims.<br /><br />what's more, his ""exclusive"" or ""unreleased"" footage is freely available over the internet from various sites.<br /><br />further reading about the circumstances regarding the filming of this production shows that he used false pretenses to gain interviews, and has used creative editing of the responses in order to promote his own opinions.<br /><br />all of the claims made by mr sibrel about ""inaccuracies"", ""mistakes"", or ""whistleblowing"" in the apollo programme have been thoroughly disproven.<br /><br />how do i get that 40-odd minutes of my life back?	1
i watched this video at a friend's house. i'm glad i did not waste money buying this one. the video cover has a scene from the 1975 movie capricorn one. the movie starts out with several clips of rocket blow-ups, most not related to manned flight. sibrel's smoking gun is a short video clip of the astronauts preparing a video broadcast. he edits in his own voice-over instead of letting us listen to what the crew had to say. the video curiously ends with a showing of the zapruder film. his claims about radiation, shielding, star photography, and others lead me to believe is he extremely ignorant or has some sort of ax to grind against nasa, the astronauts, or american in general. his science is bad, and so is this video.	1
writer/director bart sibrel bases his work here around a can of film that he says was mistakenly sent to him by nasa. he says it shows the astronauts faking the television footage of their trip to the moon by employing camera tricks. the astronauts were in low earth orbit all the time, and editors on the ground composed this raw footage into just a few seconds of finished film.<br /><br />unfortunately sibrel's research is so slipshod that he doesn't realize his ""backstage"" footage is really taken in large part from the 30-minute live telecast (also on that reel) that was seen by millions, not hidden away in nasa vaults as he implies. and we have to wonder why sibrel puts his own conspiratorial narration over the astronauts' audio in the footage, because hearing the astronauts in their own words clearly spells out that the astronauts were just testing the camera, not faking footage.<br /><br />finally, anyone can see the raw footage for themselves without having to buy sibrel's hacked-up version of it. (he shows you more of the zapruder film of jfk's assassination than of his ""smoking gun"".) sibrel thinks he's the only one who's seen it. what's more revealing is the clips from that raw footage that sibrel chose not to use, such as those clearly showing the appropriately distant earth being eclipsed by the window frames and so forth, destroying his claim that mattes and transparencies were placed in the spacecraft windows to create the illusion of a faraway earth.<br /><br />as with most films of this type, sibrel relies on innuendo, inexpert assumption, misleading commentary, and selective quotation to manipulate the viewer into accepting a conclusion for which there is not a shred of actual evidence.	1
there is a remark that one of heroines was raped on ""drunken rampage"" by russian soldiers, which is completely untrue. this movie should not be shown only because of this.<br /><br />also there is a statement by someone, that kgb prosecuted ""jews, gypsies etc"", which is ""worse than nazis"". kgb was looking for so called ""zionist"" agents, who were (kgb believed) imperialist agents. this is totally different from targeting jewry as a whole nation, as nazis did. gypsies were never prosecuted. kgb was political tool and used politically, but from internationalist standpoint. communists really did not distinguish between nationalities.<br /><br />whole movie stinks like fake. main hero does not speak russian, signs in berlin contains typographical errors, kgb general looks totally phony. some so called ""russian proverbs"" are totally made up, and list goes on and on.<br /><br />not recommended to watch - this movie is full of lies, and phony stuff. go to ""good shepherd"" instead.	1
i was really looking forward to this show given the quality of the actors and the fact that the scott brothers were involved. unfortunately my hopes were dashed! yet again we are led to believe that the kgb are a group of inept morons who don't have a clue what they are doing. at one point there is a laughable scene where 4 kgb agents couldn't handle one cia agent. i grow weary of these biased, one sided and completely inaccurate portrayals of the spy game that went on during the cold war. i find it laughable that the us is incapable of making objective movies about their involvement in ww2 and beyond. just like the pathetic u-571, where we are led to believe that the us obtained the enigma machine, again, utterly false.<br /><br />to its credit, ""the company"" is very well filmed and acted. the locales are also exceptionally well realised. alfred molina puts in a great performance as does keaton (the conflict between them is very well done). i really wanted to like this show and no doubt i will end up watching the other 2 episodes but i really wish that us productions would stop trying to portray their spies, servicemen etc as supermen who are vastly intellectually and physically superior to anyone else on the planet. it gets old fast and seriously detracts from the plausibility of what could have been a 10/10.<br /><br />s	1
i do regret that i have bought this series. i expected more action, more objective picture and more consistency. this is just a pure propaganda series, very dark, without any charm, or romanticism, it is just boredom itself. i find the actors work quite weak as well. o'donnell might seem charming as robin (with batman), but in this picture he lacks any charm. probably while he becomes older, he is loosing his childish charm but does not gain any charm of a grown up. it comes as no surprise, that it was not shown in a lot of countries and is being sold in the uk for 40% of the recommended price and was not even released in the netherlands.	1
proof that not everything tarantino touches turns to gold. this is most definitely plastic, all the way. its easy to see that without quentin's involvement this would have probably sat on the shelf for years, that's assuming it would have ever got produced in the first place. it is about a woman with a fascination of death who gets a job cleaning up after crime scenes, angela jones is unconvincing in this role, william baldwin is better as the serial killer who keeps jones in employment!. all in all pretty poor.	1
thoughtless, ignorant, ill-conceived, career-killing (where is the talented angela jones now?), deeply unfunny garbage. it's no wonder reb braddock hasn't directed anything else since - anyone who has a chance to make his first film on his own rules, based on his own script, with the help of quentin tarantino himself, and creates something like this, anyone who feels that this was a story worth telling to the world, doesn't deserve a second break. under the circumstances, the performances are good - the actors do what they're told to do, and they do it well. it's just that they shouldn't have done it in the first place. <br /><br />0 out of 4.	1
the idea is nice. bringing so many stars in one movie is great. but.... too many stories, too short and lacking really any sense. no connection between the scenes. there were some 3-4 brilliant stories... but these were out of 18. the frame reminded me of ""all the invisible children"" - a movie which i liked a lot. compared to it, however, ""paris je t'aime"" lacks the intriguing short story, which develops - starts and has its end. and it lacks the topic connecting all those - children. i do not find paris enough of a topic to connect 18 short sketches together.perhaps for people who know paris it is interesting. otherwise, i wouldn't recommend it...	1
from it's uninspiring title to the flat acting performances, curdled is very much an unremarkable film throughout. the film has gained some fans by way of the fact that quentin tarantino's name is attached to it, and the silly and out of place nod to the rodriguez/tarantino flick 'from dusk till dawn'. these things do not make a great movie, however, and this is more than evident all the way through 'curdled'. the film suffers from an all too obvious lack of ideas, and it tries to mask this with murders that are meant to be stylish and events that are supposed to be disturbing. the mexican music score that accompanies many of the sequences in the film is obviously meant to be cool, but it's becomes annoying very quickly; especially as aside from the fact that the lead character is mexican, it doesn't fit with the tone of the movie. the film's plot is typically offbeat and it follows a gorehound who, because of her obsession with grisly murders, takes a job with a firm that cleans up murder scenes. it sounds boring and it is.<br /><br />william baldwin is the only 'name' on the cast list, and even he doesn't make an impression. he hasn't been given anything to do in the movie and aside from talking to his victims and standing around trying to look menacing, he's pretty much wasted. angela jones, or rather; the taxi driver from pulp fiction, takes the lead role as the murder obsessed young woman, and it is always clear that it's her involvement with pulp fiction that won her this role, not her acting ability. she may have been good enough in her small role in tarantino's masterpiece, but she doesn't have the talent to lead a film by herself. she looks lost and out of place for the majority of the film, and if it weren't for her latino accent; she wouldn't convince the audience that she's a weirdo on any level. curdled is a one hundred percent-proof piece of forgettable trash. films like this often win themselves praise for invention or black comedic antics; but this one fails on all levels. whether you're a tarantino fan, william baldwin fan, horror fan or just a movie buff; this is one to miss.	1
excruciatingly slow-paced, over-scripted black comedy with a too-clever premise and bad acting.<br /><br />maybe this would have worked as a twilight zone or tales from the crypt episode, but by the last half, you just want it to get to its predictable ending and be done with it already.	1
geordies...salt of the earth characters...bricklayers...beer...geordies...happy go lucky...adventures working abroad...salt of the earth characters...warm wonderful people...tyne bridge (tear in the eye)...brown ale...salt of the earth characters...cute little red indians children in newcastle united tops...emetic...geordies...salt of the earth characters...<br /><br />etc etc etc....<br /><br />please. this is so poor. and you should know better timothy spall. they can't have paid you that much.<br /><br />as for jimmy nail. well the kindest thing that can be said is that he is every bit as good an 'actor' as he is a singer and writer. come on jimmy, the joke's over. 'crocodile shoes' and 'spender' were very funny, unfortunately i don't think they were supposed to be. with 'auf wiedersehen pet' the opposite applies.	1
usually i'm a bit of a fan of the bad eighties & early nineties film featuring now has beens...but this film is so incredibly terrible that it was a real endurance test to sit through. guys dressing up as girls has been done to death - but never so pathetically. corey haim's performance was abysmal as usual, nicole eggert was not much better. this has no redeeming qualities, even if you are a number #1 fan of an actor/actress in this piece of trash - stay away!	1
well, here we have yet another role reversal movie. there were many worth watching, despite the tired plot of gender reversal. however, this one is not. in previous reviews, i think i've made my point about the general decline of enjoyment for haim movies that followed the late 80s. this is one of them.<br /><br />'just one of the girls' is about a high school kid (corey haim) who tries to avoid his bullies by dressing up as a girl and attending another school. he joins the cheerleading squad and makes friends with fellow cheerleader, marie (nicole eggert). obviously, he can't keep up the charade for too much longer.<br /><br />i thought this movie was utter crap, and it wasn't even funny. but, judging by a majority of reviews, it looks like fans of alanis morrisette or teen sex queen, nicole eggert, are the only ones who'd want to watch this. if you're looking for a good haim feature (or role switching comedy), look no further than 1989. this is about the point that haim's career tanked.	1
i'd never seen a tarzan movie before so when i saw it on the tele i thought i'd give it a shot. unfortunately i have to say i was disappointed. tarzan was over 40 years old and somewhat overweight. not how i'd imagined tarzan would look. and, unless i missed it while making myself a cup of tea, tarzan never gave his traditional warbling yell. also missing was tarzan swinging through the trees - leaping from vine to vine.<br /><br />oh well, so much for expectations. anyway, jane was there - the monkey cheeta was there. there was some guy with a guitar there. there were villains and good guys and a romance... all very harmless and predictable. nothing bad, you understand, but equally nothing good.<br /><br />probably not the best movie to introduce tarzan: 4/10	1
last of the johnny weissmuller tarzan films and a good thing too, as this is easily the worst of the 12 films he made over a period of 16 years. no mermaids are featured here either as a beautiful island woman tries to escape the clutches of her people, who worship a god and try to force her to be its bride. she finds tarzan and jane, who try to protect her. george zucco is present as a potentially villainous high priest but isn't used to his full advantage. also on hand and worthy of mention is a hugely annoying guitar player/singer who goes into song every so often. even the ""great"" robert florey can't aid this one.<br /><br />*1/2 (of four)	1
the last tarzan film starring johnny weissmuller (looking surprisingly aged a year after ""tarzan and the huntress"") is bad, in spite of all the trivia one can add to make it look better. it is obvious that rko tried to make a great farewell for weissmuller, shooting in beautiful scenery in méxico, with a top star of that country (andrea palma) and multiple award-winning cinematographer gabriel figueroa, and bringing in prestigious composer dimitri tiomkin to do the score. although it may have cost less for filming abroad, it looks more expensive than any other rko film in the series, taking advantage of acapulco beaches and real pyramids as aquatania, and with impressive décors for all the scenes related to the temple of god balu (especially the exterior, built on steep rocks.) kurt neumann should have stayed as director, instead of robert florey, who gives it a very slow pace. neumann had done a fine work with ""tarzan and the amazons"", ""tarzan and the leopard woman"" and ""tarzan and the huntress"", and finished his career directing the classic ""the fly"" the year before his death; while florey became a television director, after a career of few remarkable films. if weissmuller looks tired, the chimp playing cheeta is not as good as the others, but the worst character is benji, an obnoxious mailman who sings horrendous songs (that have a caribbean air, in a location supposed to be africa and shot in méxico!) boring and decidedly of dubious taste, it was a sad farewell to weissmuller's tarzan.	1
johnny weissmuller's final film as 'king of the jungle', after 16 years in the role, tarzan and the mermaids, is bound to disappoint all but the most ardent of his fans. at 44, the ex-olympian, one of hollywood's most active 'party animals', was long past the slim athleticism of his youth, and looked tired (although he was in marginally better condition than in his previous entry, tarzan and the huntress).<br /><br />not only had weissmuller gotten too old for his role; johnny sheffield, the quintessential 'boy', had grown to manhood (he was a strapping 17-year old), so he was written out of the script, under the pretext of being 'away at school'. brenda joyce, at 35, was appearing in her fourth of five films as 'jane' (she would provide the transition when lex barker became the new tarzan, in 1949's tarzan's magic fountain) and was still as wholesomely sexy as ever.<br /><br />produced by sol lesser, at rko, on a minuscule budget, the cast and crew took advantage of cheaper labor by filming in mexico. while the location gave a decidedly hispanic air to what was supposedly darkest africa, veteran director robert florey utilized the country extensively, incorporating cliff diving and an aztec temple into the story.<br /><br />when a young island girl (tyrone power's future bride, linda christian) is rescued in a jungle river by tarzan, he learns that a local high priest (george zucco, one of filmdom's most enduring villains) had virtually enslaved the local population, threatening retribution from a living 'god' if they don't do his bidding. the girl had been chosen to become the 'god's' bride, so she fled. faster than you can say 'is this a dumb plot or what?', the girl is kidnapped by the priest's henchmen and returned to the island, and tarzan, followed by jane, colorful spanish character 'benjy' (charmingly played by john laurenz, who sings several tunes), and a government commissioner are off to take on the deity and his priest (poor cheeta is left behind). after a series of discoveries (the 'god' is simply a con man in an aztec mask, working with the priest in milking the island's rich pearl beds), a bit of brawling action, and comic relief and songs by benjy, everything reaches the expected happy conclusion.<br /><br />remarkably, tarzan and the mermaids features a musical score by the brilliant film composer, dimitri tiomkin, and is far better than what you'd expect from this 'b' movie! <br /><br />while the film would provide a less-than-auspicious end to weissmuller's time in tarzan's loincloth (he would immediately go on to play jungle jim, a more eloquent variation of the ape man, in khakis), the talent involved lifted the overall product at least a little above the total mess it could have been.<br /><br />tarzan was about to get a make over, and become much sexier...	1
be warned: this movie tells lots of love stories without any coherence.<br /><br />the only intention of this movie seems to be showing love in many different ways.<br /><br />each story has only a few minutes, so there is no development of characters and nearly no plot. just an sketchy idea of a plot. the writer tried to build in turning points that aimed to surprise the viewer. however, that just didn't work out because you didn't get to know the characters in before or these ""jokes"" were just silly.<br /><br />this is a movie about love that fails to reach your heart. a dozen times. or even more, i don't know and i don't care.	1
this movie is without a doubt the worst horror movie i've ever seen. and that's saying a lot, considering i've seen such stinkers like demon of paradise, lovers' lane, and bloody murder (which is a close second). however, i love bad horror movies, and as you can tell from my username, this one really sticks out. at times there's nothing more entertaining than a poorly made slasher flick. as for this film, the opening scene in which a woman gets fried in a tanning booth appears to have no bearing on the film whatsoever, especially since the movie fails to tell you that the event happened 2 years prior to the rest of the film. the acting is nonexistent, and most of the camera shot are of women's areas shrink wrapped in spandex. the policeman was the most stone-faced, monotone actor i've ever seen. the best/worst part of this movie, however, has to be the murder weapon. a giant safety pin?! what were they thinking? who's the killer? a disgruntled ""huggies"" employee? i'd have to give this movie an overall zero, but darned if i didn't have a blast watching it	1
want to know the secret to making a slasher film set at a fitness center work? just pad the film out with lovely ladies in super tight workout outfits and have them bump and grind the floor like they are at a gentleman's club. that's what the makers of this horrid slasher film did and that little gimmick kept me watching till the bitter end. this is the worst slasher film i have ever seen, but every time i was ready to switch the channel, they'd add another scene with the workout girls and i'd stay put. as a slasher film, killer workout fails in every category i can think of. as a showcase for beautiful girls working out, it is a success. strong recommendation to avoid, unless the thought of half the film being a big t&a show appeals to you.	1
you know jason, you know freddy, and you know leatherface. now, get ready for: the safety pin killer! that's right, in killer workout, a dumb slasher movie if i've ever seen one, the unseen murderer dispatches his (or her?) victims with an oversized, novelty safety pin. it is an odd choice to be sure, the kind of thing that deserves an explanation. naturally, the movie never even attempts to clarify where the killer acquired such a thing.<br /><br />as the title suggests, an aerobics gym is under siege by a mad killer and everyone is a suspect. in fact, the movie gives so few clues as to the identity of the killer, just about everyone in the movie is a potential murderer until they get killed. and since just about everyone but the killer winds up dead, it's really just process of elimination. <br /><br />oddly, while the entire name cast is killed off, the aerobics classes continue in earnest. in fact, nothing is capable of stopping the dancing. while three men are murdered in the next room, the workout goes on. death isn't even a factor; one character dies, but is still seen prominently in the later workout sessions. director david prior knew what he was doing when named the movie killer workout and not logical workout.<br /><br />cop chases, explosive tanning beds, and hundreds of shots of women's exposed flesh are thrown in for good measure. much like the woman caught in the tanning bed, i felt very uncomfortable by the end of killer workout. finally, thankfully, the end flashed on the screen. what happened next? you got it, shots of the women working out. not even the end of the movie can stop them!<br /><br />	1
one two three four five six seven eight and back, haha. this is a must see, first of all to see the work out. there are a lot of work out shown, see those close ups, man you will enjoy it. a few years ago a video clip was surely based on this movie. it's a slasher but without suspense. the ending is funny too, and the clothes she's wearing in the wood confronting the copper, jesus, looks like a clown. the killings are mostly done off screen, the blood flows but never too gory. there are a lot of fight scene's too, and hey, no one got hurt. and what about the weapon to kill, never seen a big one like that, won't spoil it, you must see it. and being a slasher there's a lot of t&a too. to guess who's the killer you will be trapped a few times and that's the best part, but what about the story of the copper in the woods, huh! but still due his cheesiness this one is still one that many would like to have. i'm glad that i have my copy, one of those slasher failures. but man, those clothes and not to mention the hairstyles! if you are in your 40's then this is one is back to memory lane.	1
big hair, big boobs, bad music and a giant safety pin.......these are the words to best describe this terrible movie. i love cheesy horror movies and i've seen hundreds..but this had got to be on of the worst ever made. the plot is paper thin and ridiculous, the acting is an abomination, the script is completely laughable(the best is the end showdown with the cop and how he worked out who the killer is-it's just so damn terribly written), the clothes are sickening and funny in equal measures, the hair is big, lots of boobs bounce, men wear those cut tee-shirts that show off their stomachs(sickening that men actually wore them!!) and the music is just synthesiser trash that plays over and over again...in almost every scene there is trashy music, boobs and paramedics taking away bodies....and the gym still doesn't close for bereavement!! all joking aside this is a truly bad film whose only charm is to look back on the disaster that was the 80's and have a good old laugh at how bad everything was back then.	1
this is quite possibly the most retarded 80's slasher ever realized, but how can you be harsh on a film that features non-stop images of dozens of gorgeous ladies with exhilarating bodies doing aerobic exercises, taking showers and wandering about in tight gym outfits? prior to being a horror film, ""aerobicide"" is a 90 minutes promo video to encourage the use of steroids, silicons and other body-stimulating fitness products. if you'd leave out all the footage of hunky boys lifting weights and yummy girls wiggling their butts and racks to insufferable 80's tunes, there probably only have about 15 minutes of story left. plenty of time to improvise a plot about a sadist killer slaughtering young health-freaks with a big safety pin (yeah). the film opens with an unintentionally hilarious scene of a girl getting fried between an electric sun-bathing device. several years later people turn up dead in the same spa. you don't really need to be an experienced horror fanatic or a rocket scientist to figure out there's a link between the murders and the burning incident, now do you? investigating the case are a seemingly braindead police officer (and charles napier look-alike!) and a beefcake private detective who gets lucky with the bustiest 80's beauty i've ever seen! looking through the credits, her name's dianne copeland apparently, and she didn't do anything else apart from this turkey and an imbecile troma-movie called ""surf nazis must die"". what a wasted opportunity! she may not have been a great actress, but she sure had two other big advantages that would help her move upwards in show business. the amount of gore and the quality of the make-up effects are nothing special, neither. we're treated to a couple of bizarre stabbings with a pin and some barbecued human flesh. the plot twists near the end are ridiculous and predictable, but by that time nobody is taking the film seriously anymore, anyway. ""aerobicide"" (a.k.a. ""killer workout"") is recommended in case you want to switch of all your brain functions off for one night, but nevertheless feel like watching a film! it actually would make a terrific double-feature with ""death spa"". both films have a lot of sexy and scarcely dressed babes  and both films are pretty dumb.	1
what can i say. a kamal hassan movie being horrible. he acts very well, but it is a horrible story, along with horrible direction. in my kind opinion, the director gautham menon must give up directing. there is a lot of tragedy throughout the movie. apart from that, one can just not believe how true were those horrendous crimes. there was no practicality in the movie. gautham is just running out of stories. but both kamal hassan and jyothika act really well. the villains look too ugly, though their performance was not bad. i do not think this is a sunday afternoon movie like padayappa which you can see with the family. you will not get sleep seeing this movie!! however, harris jayaraj again did a great job, and that is why i have given this movie 4 out of 10. his song 'partha modail nallae' is soulful and soothing. apart from that, great cinematography. on the whole, this is just a bad, bad movie. kamal hassan, i think, should have rejected this movie.	1
i had a lot of hopes for this movie and so watched it with a lot of expectations; basically because of kamal hassan. he is an amazing actor who has marked his foot steps in the sands of time forever. but this movie proved to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen. after watching this the movie the brutality and violence in tenebra and clockwork orange looks far better. <br /><br />the protagonist, raghavan, is a very daring police officer. who is assigned to a investigate brutal serial murders. raghavan efficiently finds the connecting thread in this case and is close to solve the murders and put the psycho killers, two psychologically disturbed but brilliant medical students, behind bars but they escape and again get into a killing spree. finally raghavan kills them both after sparing many innocent lives.<br /><br />these two psycho-killers are the ones who are going to keep the audiences from going to the theaters. the murders and sexual harassments and rapes are shown very explicitly, which the movie could have survived without. <br /><br />to even imagine that teenagers and kids are going to be watching this movie in the theater and kind of picture it is bound to paint in their minds are certainly not pretty. the director, gautham, should realize that he also has some obligation to the society and his audience.certainly i am never going to the movies looking like gautham's name on the production list.	1
on the way back from imc6 (san jose, california), all five (mind you, three of us hardcore kamal fans) of us had reached a unanimous verdict; vv was solid crap and thanks to the movie we were going to have a pretty screwed up monday. not to mention, we swore to stay off the theatres for the next year.<br /><br />i won't blame kamal here because he sort of dropped a hint in a recent interview with cartoonist madan (on vijay tv). he said something like, ""tamizh cinema'la photography, editing'la namba munnera'na maadri screenplay, direction, acting'la innum namba munnera'la"" (tamil cinema has grown in terms of photography and editing, but we have hardly improved, when it comes to screenplay, direction and acting""). while you're watching vv, those words ring very true.<br /><br />now, here are the 10 reasons to hate this movie:<br /><br />1. harris jeyaraj<br /><br />2. harris jeyaraj<br /><br />3. harris jeyaraj i'm barely holding myself from using expletives here, but fact is hj has mastered the fine knack of screwing up every recent movie of his (remember 'anniyan', 'ghajini') with the jarring cacophony, he bills as background music. the next time i have an eardrum transplant, he's paying for it. <br /><br />4. songs neither do the songs help move the movie's narration spatially/temporally nor do they make you sit up and take notice. the film feels like it's made of four very long songs with a few scenes thrown in between them.<br /><br />5. a short gone too far. vv at best is fit to be a short story, not a 2 hour plus ""thriller"". to use a cliché here, like the energizer bunny it goes on and on and on; only in this case you don't want it to. the later part of a movie feels like a big drag.<br /><br />6. kamal-jothika pairing two ice cubes rubbed together could've produced more sparks than this lead pairing. there's no reason you would root for them to make it together. in fact every time they get together in the second half of the movie, they make a good irritant to the narration. hate to say this, but kamalini mukerjhee's 10 minute romancing does more than what kamal and jothika achieve in this movie plus 'thenali'.<br /><br />7. kamal haasan's accent kamal has this pretentious accent that nobody speaks either in india or in the us; and it isn't new either. he's been doing it since 'thoongadae thambi thoongadae'. it's simply gets on the nerve. imagine what havoc it can cause when his flair for using this strange accent meets shooting on location in the us. he doesn't leave it at the immigration either, he offers doses of advice to his men (bewildered tn cops from keeranor, sathoor and beyond) in chaste kamanglish (""wha we hav here is plain bad police wok""), of course with nauseating effect.<br /><br />8. logic there are a few directors whom you expect to stand up to a certain scale. gautam fails us badly with some crappy performance in the department of common sense. which d.c.p in his senses would meet his love interest on the streets to discuss such matters as committing himself and life after! the scene inside the theatre was so bad, towards the climax; we could hear people behind us loudly challenge the hero's iq. ""is he stupid, can't he just use his siren or lights?"" (on a busy madras road, kamal-the-cop-on-a-police-jeep chases a guy on a bike just like any ordinary dude!). ""can't he just use his gun?"" (""the guy on a bike"" starts on foot and we have a fully geared kamal in hot pursuit for a considerable amount of time). i'm not voting in favour of the later, but i'm just trying to explain the mood inside.<br /><br />9. gore & violence if i wanted to watch women being raped, their throats getting slashed, more women getting raped and thrown into the bushes with excruciating authenticity, i would sit at home and rather watch a ""police report"" or ""kuttram"". the use of excessive violence should go in a way to extend the story, not overwhelm it! somewhere down the line gautum seems confused about what the extensions (rapes, murders) are and what the mainstay (story) is!<br /><br />10. even a double shot espresso couldn't get the pain out of the head.	1
filmatography: excellent, nice camera angles (i don't remember seeing a movie of late, with good close-ups, until this one). could have avoided gruesome scenes with a soft camera. ny is pictured good.i liked the upside down angles, in particular (a different touch).<br /><br />music: not impressive. songs don't stick around in your mind even after watching the movie. may be, i expected same quality like ""anniyan"". a disappointment. <br /><br />actors: kamal needs to slowly pull away from hard-core action sequences. his age and belly really show up. also, he should avoid close romantic sequences going forward. it was a very awkward to see a mature/aged star still trying to play like a 20+ heroes scenes. love can be expressed at any age; as we get older, you still can express love nicely from a distance (without touching a woman too much. for example, the love expressed by rajinikanth in ""chandrmukhi"").<br /><br />jyotika just appears for the namesake in the movie. not sure why she accepted this. well, that is not my problem, i guess.<br /><br />others just have a small presence.<br /><br />direction: i expected gautham to excel (or measure-up) to his other movie ""kakka kakka"". he disappointmented me. it took a long time to release the movie due to various issues. he slips in few scenes. even abvious things got slipped from a famous director.<br /><br />overall: just a okay movie. too much graphics. definitely not for kids (and adults who expect some kind of ""entertainment"").<br /><br />thx	1
based upon the recommendation of a friend, my wife and i invited another couple to this film. i really apologized to them--all 4 of us hated it and spent the whole time looking at our watches waiting for the film to finally end. half the vignettes are bizarre, with very little entertainment value. there were few scenes of paris--for example, i was looking forward to seeing some pictures of the latin quarter, but i couldn't really recognize anything. most of the scene was inside a bar. no one in the theater laughed at anything, or reacted in any way. if you like bizarre, pretentious, pseudo-intellectual films, don't miss this. if you are down to earth like me, you will be sorry you saw it.	1
i pity people calling kamal hassan 'ulaganaayakan' maybe for them ulagam is tollywood ! comeon guys..this movie is a thriller without thrill..<br /><br />come out of your ulagam and just watch some high class thrillers like the usual suspects or even the silence of the lambs.<br /><br />technically good but style over substance kamal doesn't look like a police officer, there is no thrill whatsoever dragging and boring till end you might be saving 3 valuable hrs of your life if u skip watching this movie.<br /><br />kamal at his best is the best in tollywood	1
it's ""the f.b.i."" starring reed hadley, with an all-star guest cast! the film begins with an accidental (convenient?) kidnapping, which leads to one thing, and another - which doesn't really indicate the main story, which is a ""big house, u.s.a."" prison break story. the story is very improbable, to say the least. it's like a tv show, only more ""violent"" (for the times).<br /><br />but - the cast is a trip! picture this: ralph meeker is sent to prison; his cell-mates are the following criminals: broderick crawford, lon chaney jr., charles bronson (reading a ""muscle"" magazine!), and william talman (reading a ""detective"" magazine!). honest! you should know that, an early scene reveals what happens to the ""missing"" boy, answering the ending ""voiceover."" if you don't want to have that hanging, don't miss the opening scenes between the ""iceman"" and the boy (peter votrian doing well as a runaway asthmatic). <br /><br />*** big house, u.s.a.

i am definitely a burt reynolds fan, but sorry, this one really stinks. most of the dialogue is laughable and the only interesting plot twist is in the last five minutes of the movie. i can't believe he even made this one. is he actually that hard up for money?	1
the movie was not a waste except for some boring scenes in between.but the women cast gave a pretty good show than the males who were laughable. <br /><br />but krista allen really rocked in the movie .her voice was so seducing and sexy.the scenes in the bed involving krista should have shortened but she made it so watchable and sexier than any one could do.krista really is one of the best in such roles.she also enacted quiet well as the baddie in the last 5 minutes,which is the interesting part of the movie.<br /><br />burt reynolds was not that good and this was not his best as an action star.he could have chosen a better script than this.ireally think he did for money.	1
a very tired looking burt reynolds plays a mercenary battling his former employers for some gizmo these non-heroes plan to sell to ""the iranians."" low-rent video nonsense by the producers of ""silk stalkings"" offers some decent action footage and a lot of ineptly staged ""drama""...a lack of logic and truly dreadful dialogue are the defining aspects, although the final twists and allegiance shifts could've been a nifty end to a better movie. burt still has presence, although it also means you notice more when he mouths insultingly half-baked ""one-liners"".	1
about three minutes into this thing i started fast-forwarding, pausing only during the nudity (why is it that bad movies always include such good looking women?). in ten minutes i was done, and wishing i could get my money back from the rental store. the people who write these movies should be sanctioned by the mpaa. come on writers - the bad guys always get into the car with the bomb activated by the good guy's remote control! that's the way its been done since the days of the ottoman empire! also, to add insult to injury, the ""twist"" at the end was so formulaic, that it could have come from any action movie written in the past 25 years. burt reynolds was fine, but he should concentrate on real movies.<br /><br />this movie is just a waste of time - run away! run away!	1
i rented this movie from the library (it's hard to find for good reason) purely out of curiosity. i'm a huge plath fan and this movie was a complete disappointment. the bell jar (1979) is by far one of the worst movies i've ever seen. the script is horrible, not because it strays from the original novel text, but because it strays without focus or intent. the scenes are ill-constructed and don't lead the viewer anywhere. what's with the hokey voice over of plath's poetry? lady lazarus has little do with greenwood's situation; plath's poetry was completely misused. marilyn hassett is completely unbelievable as esther greenwood (or any 20 year old for that matter) partly due to casting (she was 32 during filming, the age plath was when she died) and partly due to the fact that she can't act. hassett is all emotion, no craft, no skill. the direction is mediocre; the director simply covers what's there, which isn't much. the only reason i'm giving the film a 1 is because 0 isn't an option. sorry sylvia, you'll have to wait for someone else to adapt your fine work into something more fitting.	1
horrible acting, horrible cast and cheap props. would've been a lot better if was set as an action parody style movie. what a waste. starting from the name of the movie.<br /><br />""the enemy"" naming it ""action movie"" would've made it better. (contributing to the parody effect). the cop looking like a 60 year old player, the blond girl just having the same blank boring look on her face at all times. towards the end of the movie him and her are working together to take down the bad guys and every time they exchange words it just feels like the cheap lines given before a sex scene in a porn movie. horrible. don't waste your time.	1
while the premise behind the house where evil dwells may be intriguing, the execution is downright pathetic. i'm not even sure where to begin as i've got so many problems with this movie. i suppose i'll just number a few of them: <br /><br />1. the acting  when you see that edward albert, doug mcclure, and susan george (and her teeth) are the stars of your movie, you know you're in trouble? not that it matters much to me, but these are hardly a-list names. susan george may have been in a couple of movies i enjoy, but i've never considered her the greatest actress i've ever seen. and in this movie, her acting is embarrassing. as for the other two, the less said the better.<br /><br />2. the ghosts  the ghosts or spirits or whatever you want to call them reminded me quite a bit of the ghosts in the haunted mansion ride.at disney world. and, they are about as frightening. and why did they have to be so obvious? subtlety is not a characteristic of the house where evil dwells.<br /><br />3. the plot  how predictable can one movie be? the outcome of this movie is painfully obvious once you meet the three main characters. if you couldn't see where this movie was headed after about 15 minutes, you need to see more movies.<br /><br />4. the convenient priest  what are the chances that the haunted house you buy just happens to be across the street from a group of japanese monks? not to mention that one of them knows the history of your house and comes over, knocks on the door, and asks if you need help removing evil spirits. absurd is a word that comes to mind.<br /><br />5. everything else  it's very difficult for me to think of any positives to write about. i suppose i'll give it a point for the opening scene and a point for the house's architecture. that's a sure sign of a winner  noting the architecture as a highlight of any film doesn't say much about the actual movie.<br /><br />i'll stop. you should be able to get the idea from what i've already mentioned. and, i haven't even mentioned the annoying little girl or the invasion of the crabs or a multitude of other problems. be warned, this thing is horrible.	1
being a filmmaker myself, and possessing a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humour, i thought i was in for a treat when i took home ""my wrongs..."" (not that the dvd cover gives anything away, instead opting for the ambiguous quote from controversialist director, chris morris, ""a short film including scenes""). i should have known better really, and avoided this insipid (and often offensive) piece of twoddle.<br /><br />the scene in the church is repulsive to watch (especially since we are all too familiar with morris's warped attitude towards paedophilia from his notorious tv series, brass eye) and serves no purpose other than to shock. how this film is labelled a comedy i will never understand.<br /><br />the runner's commentary sounds like a novel idea in principle (having been a runner myself, it's often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filmmaking process), however this is sadly not the case here. instead, we are treated to some public schoolboy ranting about dogs on film, before concluding that there are no really great movies starring dogs. this is all very interesting, but not worth a single frame of celluloid.<br /><br />to say that this film goes nowhere would be an understatement. it relies far too heavily upon its heightened style, at the expense of plot, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer strangely perturbed and unfulfilled. its over-simplified message - that man should take responsibility for his actions - is both glaringly obvious and poorly illustrated.<br /><br />the film does have its moments of pseudo-kafkaesque surrealism, but ultimately, it fails to convince, to entertain, to enlighten and just ends up being irritating. if you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking, i strongly recommend ""franz kafka's it's a wonderful life"", by peter capaldi.	1
there are no reasons to watch this movie. should you have won and extreme amount of money and having spent your time discovering life's every pleasure and have come to a point where by chance you are at a loose end and have some time to kill (like that would ever happen) then get this movie from the video shop (if you can find it and put up with the assistant laughing at you then ask for this movie. be prepared however for you mind to be invaded by extremely wooden acting by absolutely everyone (in fact the best acting was by the people who said nothing). oliver reed tops off his grand career by playing a drunk - go figure. but wait i forgot there is one reason to watch this movie - claudia udy showing her chest! sadly no other reason than that!	1
i loved the first season. the quality went down a little bit in the second season, which however had a great middle (pegasus!). third season was fairly novel and original and was ok. fourth season started going downhill fast, because they never even began giving us any explanations, when by now we were really starting to need them. what the hell was the cylon plan? why were there two cylon factions? what was the point of angel-kara leading the fleet to a devastated earth-1? what kind of a past did the last five cylons have, and how did they survive, or were they reincarnations? questions everywhere, answers nowhere.<br /><br />and then comes the end. earth-2 (our earth) in the past. well, okay. but destroying the fleet?! giving up technology and giving up any kind of urban life, and spreading a few thousand people paper-thinly across the planet?! that's not only anti-science, it's anti-reason and anti-life. and the philosophy of the show then seems to be that humanity is forever trapped in a cycle going from nature romanticism to a decadent capitalist society inventing destructive a.i. that ruins everything. it is without vision, without hope for a grander future for humanity, and it is antithetical to proper science fiction. and don't even get me started on the angels! religious claptrap of the worst kind! the ultimate disappointment!!<br /><br />the whole ""all this has happened before and will happen again"" thing should have related to the previous incarnation of the series, not just to earth as we know it. making the new show somehow consistent with the old would have been the definitive stroke of genius. frakkin shame.<br /><br />1 out of 10.	1
""raising victor vargas"" is one of those light, family movies that you can watch and do the n.y. times crossword puzzle at the same time. and if you want to go to the kitchen for a taco and a corona, you don't have to ""pause"" the dvd. just let it roll, 'cause you won't be missing anything really important. no twists, turns, or tension. it's not really an ethnic movie, it's a movie about a poor, struggling immigrant family that happens to be latino. they could have been any ethnic group. it made very little difference. i've seen it all a zillion times before. just plug in a jewish family, an italian family, a black family, or an irish family. just the accents and names were different. if the vargas family was named bush or clinton and were presbyterians, the movie would have been a total snooze. <br /><br />it's funny that the critics here couldn't get the locale straight. some said it was spanish harlem. some the bronx, and another brooklyn. as a life-long new yorker, i vote for the lower east side. and it seemed that the family never met up with anyone except other latinos. they lived in an insulated/isolated little enclave. some interaction with non-latinos might have created some excitement, interest, or tension. remember west side story?<br /><br />and now for the oft-criticized cinematography. i don't know if it was my tv or what, but all the indoor shots looked very orange to me. the apt, the furniture, and the faces were all orange. what was that supposed to mean? and the apt. did look pretty cramped to me. somebody here mentioned that the old apt's/tenements had very big rooms. well, maybe 50 years ago. what landlords have done is to break up one big apt into 2 or 3 very small ones and squeeze as many immigrants as they can into them. <br /><br />and another annoying thing ....this is the second family movie i've seen and criticized this week that featured a teenage boy ""jerking off"". is this private sex act necessary for us to watch? please spare me! what's up with these directors? <br /><br />so ""victor vargas"" is a pleasant little movie. it was nice for a change to see young latino actors given a break and a chance to show their talents, which they did. but the writers let them down, giving them a flat, unspectacular script to work with. enjoy the show, but keep your fingers near the ""fast forward"" button.	1
i didn't know what to expect from the film. well, now i know. this was a truly awful film. the screenplay, directing and acting were equally bad. the story was silly and stupid. the director could have made a smart and thought provoking film, but he didn't. i squirmed in my seat for the last half of the movie because it was so bad. where was the focus to the film? where was anything in this film? christians should boycott this film instead of promoting it. it was shabbily done and a waste of my money. do not see this film.	1
my main comment on this movie is how zwick was able to get credible actors to work on this movie? impressive cast  even for the supporting characters, none of which helps this movie really. i have to admit though, tom hank's cameo almost made it worth it  what was that about tom? did you lose a bet? the best cameo of the movie was joe isuzu though - by far a classic! the premise is good. basinger's character, struggling with existence as a pink lady, is making her way toward vegas motel by motel pitching the glorious pyramid of cosmetic sales. this happens as corbett's character is on his way to vegas to deliver an elvis suit to his soon to be ex-wife motivated by.what else.extortion. as they both make their way, they have numerous run-ins with elvis impersonators who on their way to an elvis impersonating convention in vegas. soon, the fbi gets involved and begins to track what they think is an elvis impersonator serial killer. unfortunately, premise doesn't mean the movie was good.<br /><br />when watching this movie, imagine you are back in the first grade  when story lines and continuity aren't really important. it is much more enjoyable to just watch basinger look beautiful in her pink lady outfit rather than wondering why what she is doing doesn't really make sense. the movie tries hard, but ultimately falls way way way short. ultimately, it is filled with ideas that could have theoretically been funny but in practice were not that funny.<br /><br />it isn't the worst, but you may find you yourself feel like leaving the building when watching this one don't say i didn't warn you!	1
i saw this film yesterday.. i rented the dvd from blockbuster.. in fact, i know one of the actresses from the film.. i won't sa"	1
this movie was a mess. it had the absolute worst editing i have ever seen. it was almost like at the end of a scene the writer wanted to go to commercial, and the filmmaker added a second of black screen to fulfill the writers dream.<br /><br />under the messy direction and editing, there was a glimmer of something good. a good idea, a compelling spark. but somewhere it went wrong.<br /><br />the story is about a quasi-psychic priest who is trying to solve a string of murders. the first thing that is hard to bite into is richard grieco as a priest. well the part doesn't call for him to be a good priest and he succeeds rather well. the second problem is dennis hopper as the crazy bad guy. he always plays the crazy bad guy. very ho hum.<br /><br />oh, a thought occured to me that maybe all the jumpy, horrible editing and disconnected plot was trying to add a sense of the confusion the character (grieco) was experiencing. and just to prove that it was contrived they rolled the credits backwords. not a good sign for any movie.<br /><br />	1
this was an impulse pick up for me from the local video store. don't make the same mistake i did. this movie is tedious, unconvincingly acted, and generally boring. the dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is particularly poorly written and delivered; i cringed at every scene they shared. dennis hopper makes a few sparse appearances and is his usual disjointed self; his role was clearly not a stretch for him. and although the movie is supposedly set in puerto rico, it feels a lot more like a hollywood movie lot; all of the main characters are caucasian and several tend to speak english with pseudo-irish accents. odd. anyway, when you see this one on the shelf of your local video store, keep walking.	1
"first of all, what is good in the movie ? some pretty actress ? the exotic background ? the fact that the actors don't laugh while acting (i would have if i had been in their situation) ? i don't know. the storyline is simple : a catholic priest who does abstract painting tries to find out who (another abstract painter) killed his little brother, a male prostitute (raped by another priest when he was young...). i'm afraid there is nothing here to learn or to let think a little about serial killers, art or religion. dennis hopper is not very good here. this is the worst episode of the worst season of ""profiler"" (the serie) with replacement actors and unbelievable coincidences (the uncle is the policeman who, the girl who lives at another victim's house could have a baby with the priest, etc., etc)."	1
"i'll give writer/director william gove credit for finding someone to finance this ill-conceived ""thriller."" a good argument for not wasting money subscribing to hbo, let alone buying dvds based on cover art and blurbs. a pedestrian dennis hopper and a game richard grieco add nothing significant to their resumes, although the art direction is not half bad. the dialogue will leave you grimacing with wonder at its conceit; this is storytelling at its worst. no tension, no suspense, no dread, no fear, no empathy, no catharsis, no nothing. a few attractive and often nude females spice up the boredom, but this is definitely a film best seen as a trailer. i feel sorry for the guy who greenlighted this thing. good for late-night, zoned-out viewing only. you have been warned."	1
"a splendid example of how hollywood could (and still can) take a masterpiece of literary fiction and stupidly foul it up.<br /><br />in the case of ""the big sky,"" writer dudley nichols and company arrogantly assumed they could improve upon a classic pioneer novel by the pulitzer prize-winning author, a.b. guthrie. in so doing, they removed the soul of the story and any edge and impact it may have had as a film adaptation.<br /><br />the epic nature of guthrie's book and the evolution of its main character, boone caudill, from a naive, kentucky lad into a hardened and competent survivor/mountain man, has been replaced with a downscaled riverboat farce that bears little resemblance to the author's intent. in the movie version, boone's presence is nothing except underwhelming.<br /><br />intriguing and even shocking plot elements that give guthrie's novel impact and excitement have been removed for no apparent reason whatsoever. most puzzling of all is the emphasis placed upon the zeb calloway character, who was an incidental, minor character in the book, only occupying a handful of pages. on the other hand, a very important and fascinating character, dick summers, the veteran pioneer, is missing altogether!!! it is also apparent that director hawks decided the zeb character in the movie, played by actor hunnicutt, wasn't irritating enough. so zeb/hunnicutt was given a significant amount of time doing that obnoxious, voice-over narration that is the hollywood short cut for incompetent screen writing, editing, and direction.<br /><br />some movies have actually improved upon the books upon which they were based (william wyler's ""ben-hur"" is an excellent example). but this is horrible and depressing not only as an adaptation of a novel but as a film unto itself.<br /><br />the story is dull and clichéd, and the characters - at least the ones that have not been edited out of the script - are just shallow and boring shadows of guthrie's literary vision. and unfortunately, kirk douglas' star appeal, which could have helped lift this film, was scuttled by the milktoast role he was given.<br /><br />if you can believe it, the film version of guthrie's pulitzer prize-winning sequel, ""the way west,"" also starring kirk, is even worse.<br /><br />in my opinion, ""the big sky"" further solidifies howard hawks' place as one of the most overrated, tepid directors in the history of cinema."	1
anyone that has see tammuz's child eaters knows that this is a director that can do better. let's hope it was not a case of too many hands in the pot (telefilm anyone?)and that is was a case of second feature jitters. the characters are one dimensional and over used. the scenery is terrific however and showcases the pacific northwest beautifully.<br /><br />the cinematography is great. shot almost entirely outside, the images are crisp and beautiful. you can almost smell the wind blowing through the leaves.<br /><br />technically this movie is as sound as they come - it just lacks a heart.	1
"not only was this the most expensive canadian film ever shot in bc, but easily the worst, never seeing the light of day. the director is not even canadian, but british, and boy does it show. we are all made out to be a bunch of over-sexed dope fiends and morons. the spirit of what it means to be canadian is absent, and this is supposed to be the reason we fund this bunk. of course the british character is normal. the rest are a crop of sitcom stereotype - can you say ""norm!!""? the cinematography ranges from pretty postcard images to murky indoor silhouettes. the actors always seem to be fidgetting. are they as bored as the viewer, or is this the directors idea of cinema? avoid this mess and check out some of bruce mcdonalds films. a true canadian boy with something original to say cinematically. you won't be compelled to walk out on his films after 10 minutes."	1
this movie makes canadians and brits out to be asinine, moronic idiots. the men get stoned/drunk, and then they yell/beat each other up in almost every scene. the women are superfluous to the story  i do not understand what they are there for  they spend every scene causing a ruckus, or worse, milling around like mesmerized cattle. apparently, canadian women are either quarrelsome vulgar tramps or hulking hippie chicks. it's the standard knocked-up girlfriend, her loser boyfriend and his wicked mother ludicrousness that we have seen in countless movies before.<br /><br />every character here is a carping, infantile stereotype. not to mention that they all looked like they need a shower! and the idea of any kind of scene implying sex with george wendt  shudder  is enough to make anyone gag! i watched the movie because samuel west was in it  but i cannot understand why he would have accepted a role like this. maybe he needed the money. ian tracey is a superb actor - the only one with a vague redeeming moment, but his talent is wasted here.<br /><br />as for the rest of the plot  the three imbeciles trying to get their dope back  yawn - or karl  who is dead, but who is actually a character very much alive in the minds of those left behind (almost like rebecca in alfred hitchcock's masterpiece  although i am ashamed to even have thought to compare these two films), why even bother? karl is so galling that you find the circumstances of his death gratifying.<br /><br />by the end of this wretched movie, i thought they would all have been better off going down with him on that boat!	1
i found this on the shelf while housesitting and bored. how can people possibly give this a 10? it's not just that it's supposed to be a feel-good redemption film (i think), because it doesn't work on that level either. weak plot, bad dialogue, terrible acting; there's just nothing there. harvey keitel is decent, but has nothing to work with, and bridget fonda and especially johnathon schaech are just terrible. the plot progression (especially the relationship between byron and ashley) makes no sense. it seems like the writers wanted the plot to go a certain way and made it, without actually writing in the necessary bits to make it flow. it's only an hour and a half, but that's 90 minutes of your life you'll never get back.	1
"this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen. branaugh seemed to have so much trouble remembering his accent that he couldn't deliver his lines. the plot was definitely not worthy of john grisham's name. no wonder it was never published as a book or released in theaters. i didn't even watch the whole thing. i decided i didn't care who done it, then realized there was no ""whodunit"" to care about!"	1
might contain possible spoilers (not that anything in this film is new or will even mildly surprise you for that matter)<br /><br />why does disney feel the need to recycle everything they ever made into oblivion? sure it's cheaper for them, but after a while, wouldn't you think there overall quality and the way people think of them would drop off. house of villains is a despicable display of cartoon crossovers that make absolutely no sense at all. some signs of the total disregard for previous films in this are: the voices don't even remotely match up and iago is evil again (since when?!) i know that these films are directly towards children but there was a time when all could enjoy disney films. even the movie's musical number (which had been disney's specialty for years) stunk. i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone even the very young. all i can is that if more of these movies of the same caliber are released, it's only a matter of time before some small animation studio surpasses disney in overall quality.	1
"have not watched kids films for some years, so i missed ""here come the tigers"" when it first came out. (never even saw ""bad news bears"" even though in the '70s i worked for the guys who arranged financing for that movie, ""warriors,"" ""man who would be king,"" and ""rocky horror picture show,"" among others.) now i like to check out old or small movies and find people who have gone on to great careers despite being in a less than great movie early on. just minutes into this movie i could take no more and jumped to the end credits to see if there was a young actor in this movie who had gone on to bigger and better things--at least watching for his/her appearance would create some interest as the plot and acting weren't doing the job. lo and behold, i spied wes craven's name in the credits as an electrical gaffer. he'd already made two or three of his early shockers but had not yet created freddie krueger or made the ""scream"" movies. maybe he owed a favor and helped out on this pic. more surprising was fred j. lincoln in the cast credits as ""aesop,"" a wacky character in the movie. f.j. lincoln, from the '70s to just a few years ago, appeared in and produced adult films. he was associated with the adult spoof ""the ozporns,"" and just that title is funnier than all of ""tigers"" attempts at humor combined. let the fact that an adult actor was placed in a kids movie be an indication as to how the people making this movie must have been asleep at the wheel."	1
the saddest part of this is the fact that these are 87 minutes i'll never get back. i knew this was terrible from the get-go, with the guy dressed as a lunatic indian chief on top of the roof. (see if they could get away with that in 2008). my 10-year-old boy is really into baseball right now, so we decided to rent it on a rainy day. even though he seemed to enjoy parts of it, i had to cringe when i heard all the needless foul language. bad, bad movie. this was an awful ripoff of bad news bears. completely shameless and completely predictable. i don't mind a predictable movie if it's done well, but this one absolutely was not.	1
"i just watched this horrid thing on tv. needless to say it is one of those movies that you watch just to see how much worse it can get. frankly, i don't know how much lower the bar can go. <br /><br />the characters are composed of one lame stereo-type after another, and the obvious attempt at creating another ""bad news bears"" is embarrassing to say the very least.<br /><br />i have seen some prized turkeys in my time, but there is no reason to list any of them since this is ""numero uno"".<br /><br />let me put it to you this way, i watched the vanilla ice movie, because it was so bad it was funny. this...this...is not even that good."	1
"this movie is horrible! it rivals ""ishtar"" in the number of embarrassingly bad moments. i would have rated it lower than a 3, save for a couple of funny lines; but, overall, this film was crap! it looked like they made it over a weekend at some bankrupt resort somewhere. joe roth should join elaine may on the directing sidelines forever!"	1
when my wife and i decided to watch this movie we thought it couldn't fail. i love billy crystal, my wife loves julia roberts and everyone we talked to said they loved it.<br /><br />we were misled, in spades.<br /><br />on my part, i felt billy crystal's character was extremely one-dimensional and did very little for the film. sure, he cracked a couple of good jokes, but as a character he did nothing but take up space.<br /><br />and poor julia roberts. in past shows she plays well as a strong-willed, self-determined lady. in this flick, she seems completely repressed and had very little fire. this is not the julia roberts that my wife enjoys watching.<br /><br />ok, if i were to find one good thing, it would have to be christopher walken. now that's entertainment. but, just like billy crystal, hardly anything is shown of his character.<br /><br />if you're looking for a night of mindless laughs with very little redeeming value, go see it. but if you're looking for a smart, romantic comedy, this is not your film. it's none of the above.	1
shame on julia roberts and john cusack. they are so talented and should not have had any part in this movie. the storyline was dumb and predictable. the jokes were not funny. the romance was not really romance. i was all too happy when this movie ended.	1
characters you don't care about, relationships you don't care about and you sit through all that to see the ending you knew was coming from the start. julia roberts usually leaves no impression on me one way or the other. she was actually somewhat endearing in this role.	1
i found this film to be an utter dissapointment. the talent available to the director- notably stanley tucci, chris walken, hank azaria and alan arkin (without even mentioning the four main leads)- have been completely wasted on an unfunny, mediocre story, whose conclusion one couldn't really care about once introduced to the dire, stereo-typed characters. julia roberts is feeble, zeta-jones is just plain annoying (appearing to reprise her role from high fidelity, minus the humour), crystal just plays his same old hyper-active, neurotic, annoying alter-ego and cusack simply walks through his part, apparently bored with the whole project.<br /><br />for what is supposed to be a 'romantic comedy', there is absolutely no romance between the central characters, let alone chemistry, and as for the comedy- (possible spoilers)well, the only moments of mild humour came off the back of cusack's role in grosse pointe and his relationship with alan arkin- the scriptwriter obviously unable to show any originality whatsoever. (spoilers) azaria was reasonably amusing as the mexican lover and walken did quite an amusing turn as a parody of an arthouse-maverick-dogme type director- but these parts constituted very little screen time and instead (spoilers) we were treated to billy crystal having his groin sniffed by a dog. pure genius.<br /><br />for a huge fan of the majority of john cusack's work, not to mention the rest of the fantastic cast, i was completely let down by a film with plenty of good ideas, and at the same time completely unwilling to explore or elaborate on any of them, instead resorting to the same old genre cliches and even lowering itself to the depths of almost 'gross-out, teen-movie' humour at times.<br /><br />a very poor 4/10.	1
"have you ever heard the saying that people ""telegraph their intentions?"" well in this movie, the characters' actions do more than telegraph future plans -- they show up at your house drunk and buffet you about the head. this could be forgiven if the setting had been used better, or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced. embeth davidtz's character is not mysterious, just wooden, and kenneth branagh doesn't succeed in conveying the brash charm his character probably was written to have.<br /><br />the bottom line: obvious plot, one-note performances, unlikeable characters, and grotesque ""southern"" accents employed by british actors."	1
billy crystal normally brings the crowd to laughter, but in this movie he and all the rest of them cannot bring any smile on my face.... or perhaps just one. they call it comedy, i say it's a waste of my time.	1
"in fact, it never was. i'm not sure why billy crystal wanted to recreate a 1940s screwball comedy. what a vacuous shambles! none of these people come close to a cary grant, spencer tracy, katherine hepburn, etc, and anyway, today's audience isn't as receptive to this facile muck. writing is trivial. the hackneyed plot is razor thin and obvious. the chemistry between the leading characters is non-existent. it's interesting that julia roberts seems to think she's a reincarnation of some big star from the ""golden age of hollywood"", whenever that may be. it's an effect she tries and fails to attain yet again with richard gere in runaway bride."	1
the only scenes wich made me laugh where the ones with christopher walken in it(the crazy filmdirector)the rest of the movie was just boring.in the first hour or so nothing really happens.jokes which supposed to be funny aren't and zeta jones douglas is really overacting.julia roberts does a routine job of the former ugly duck (yeah right!) into the girl next door (where did i see this before?) who gets the guy.for short.i really didn't care what would happen with the main characters.if cusack really fell of the building in a suicide attempt the movie could have been more interresting to watch.	1
i have seen a lot of bad movies with big actors in it. but this movie was terrible. i have yet to see why people thought it was funny. the idea behind it is stupid. plus all the things that are supposed to be funny are just dumb. why anyone would want to watch this more than once just baffles me!	1
"it was disgusting and painful. what a waste of a cast! i swear, the audience (1/2 full) laughed twice in 90 minutes. this is not a lie. do not even rent it.<br /><br />zeta jones was just too mean to be believable.<br /><br />cusack was ok. just ok. i felt sorry for him (the actor) in case people remember this mess.<br /><br />roberts was the same as she always is. charming and sweet, but with no purpose. the ""romance"" with john was completely unbelievable."	1
"wow, what a great cast! julia roberts, john cusack, christopher walken, catherine zeta-jones, hank azaria...what's that? a script, you say? now you're just being greedy! surely such a charismatic bunch of thespians will weave such fetching tapestries of cinematic wonder that a script will be unnecessary? you'd think so, but no. america's sweethearts is one missed opportunity after another. it's like everyone involved woke up before each day's writing/shooting/editing and though ""you know what? i've been working pretty hard lately, and this is guaranteed to be a hit with all these big names, right? i'm just gonna cruise along and let somebody else carry the can."" so much potential, yet so painful to sit through. there isn't a single aspect of this thing that doesn't suck. even julia's fat suit is lame."	1
how this film was made with so many big stars is beyond me. this is a terrible cliché' ridden film with the worst acting any of these actors have ever done. it really surprises me that so many of these a list stars would agree to this unfunny film. what's even worse is the fact that is made almost 100 million here in the states. it does go to show however that big stars can pull in the bucks, even if the film is terrible. i felt sorry for everyone involved in this snore-fest. billy crystal tried his best with the what he was given and the rest of the stars seemed to be walking through the motions. whatever you do, don't fall for the excellent cast because no one could have saved this.	1
let me put it another way: balls. or, how about bollo*ks. this is truly awful, more embarrassing than those it attempts to satirise. julia roberts is a skilled actress, and usually her work is of the highest standard. this movie is so lacking in direction even she struggles to look proficient. normally she is the consummate professional, yet i swear that in her eyes, there were signs of bewilderment and despair.<br /><br />the one thing that might have rescued this move was the idea about the director (chris walken) turning the movie into a secret documentary about the actors. unfortunately, that theme wasn't explored to it's full potential. too little, too late.<br /><br />zeta jones was wooden, cusack was cusack, and crystal should stick to acting. the two talented ex-buffy stars had different experiences - green hopelessly mis-cast, and balfour under-used. well done to julia for just about preventing this from being the worst movie ever made.	1
"and i mean ultra light. this film features four giant stars, about three and a half jokes and nothing beyond that.<br /><br />there really isn't too much to say about this stinker, other than that although it has a couple of really good bits, most of it isn't very funny. nor does it work at all as a romance. how about as a romantic comedy? not on your life. most of the dialogue is way too flat to be sophisticated, much less amusing.<br /><br />what's really ashame is the premise is not bad at all. this movie could have been so much more, especially with all the recent focus on some of the bogus ways in which films are promoted, complete with phony quotes from critics. the film uncovers the un-mined territory of the press junket -- those all expense paid trips for journalists who almost always write nice reviews. but instead of exploring what should have been a motherlode of jokes, it devotes all of about three minutes to this territory and moves on in pursuit of the film's lame romance.<br /><br />the same with catherine zeta-jones' character -- the whinny, self centered movie star. zeta-jones does a good job with what she's given, but she's given practically nothing. it's all homogenized junk that looks very pale in comparison with some of the things we've heard about stars over the years.<br /><br />in the end, it is hard to understand what made zeta-jones, julia roberts, john cusack and billy crystal sign aboard this doomed ship, which sinks like a rerun of ""the love boat."" in fact, as the old joke goes, they should have forgotten the script and filmed the deal. it would probably make a better story. so, go ahead and tell us, filmmakers, what do you have on these stars that got them to appear in this?"	1
"if you are expecting to see a lot in the bath of alt&#305;oklar, as it is promised by the tag line, you will be very disappointed to see that the movie consists of nothing but the populist style of alt&#305;oklar regarding most famous issues like sex, marriage and cheating. to much nudity, which seems to appear from nowhere and has no connection or whatsoever to the plot proves that alt&#305;oklar was unsuccessfully to ""try something new"" as he has quoted. to much sex centered jokes seems to show that alt&#305;oklar had fallen for the famous saying which is ""sex sells."" i was hoping to see a very good story told with a very good narration technique. however in the end i found myself sitting down for 90 minutes and watching alt&#305;oklar's experimental yet still to much focused on popularism work."	1
divorced lawyer rick magruder (branagh) stumbles drunk out of a party hosted by his firm one night and has a chance meeting with a woman named mallory doss (davidtz), who was a waitress at the party and seems to have lost her car. rick drives the woman to her home and there they discover that her car has been already parked there, seemingly by her father, dixon doss (duvall). rick and mallory walk into the house arguing about the situation when mallory carelessly undresses in front of rick, and he then spends the night with her.<br /><br />rick wakes up in the morning and mallory encounters him later in the day, asking him to file suit against her father because of his dangerous behavior. rick, now obsessed with mallory and willing to do anything for her, is successful in having dixon put on trial and sent to prison, but when he is freed by his local friends, rick finds himself in a trouble, trying to protect himself and his children from the danger he has unknowingly brought to life.	1
first of all, i am not a huge fan of contemporary turkish cinema, which is because, the usual pattern of creating a box office success is by hitting below the waistline. this movie is nothing of an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos, as the director and marketing ads imply. in my mere opinion, the sole purpose of this movie is make money by touching a sensitive morale(in fact it is mostly considered taboo in the native country) cheap populism might provide with a brief definition of what i meant.<br /><br />however, the acting is near perfect. in fact, most of the cast has theatrical background and tried hard to compensate for what altioklar lacked; talent! all members of the cast were perfectly fit in their roles and well qualified for the job, even the less experienced ones. (like janset) at least, altioklar deserves a small word of appreciation , just because he knows well how to choose the cast. other than that, he is just a media monkey, who presumes himself a director with an artistic talent. come on, art is not something that solely consists of dealing with naked/half naked women. and just because media boasts off, no director becomes a milestone in the history of turkish cinema. just close your ears and o something real artistic, i am waiting eagerly to applause your next work. hope, this time you manage to achieve an artistic approach.<br /><br />in short; pros > good acting, hot women (just kidding!) :) cons> each and every single thing, other than the cast	1
terrible movie. if there is one turkish film you should avoid seeing in 2006, that should be banyo. what a waste of time. other than couple of cheap laughs this movie achieves nothing, nada, zilch, nil. the dialog is cheap, and sexual clichés are all over it. the director needs to watch more films before attempting to direct his own. the red headed women displays examples of what an actress should not do. if you are interested in learning how not to act this is a perfect example of bad acting. the only good thing i can say about the movie is, wait, wait, there is nothing good i can say about it. i must have really disliked it to write about it this much. jeez!	1
i saw this film at the 2005 toronto international film festival. based on a novella by science- fiction author brian aldiss, this film attempts to tell the story of tom and barry howe, conjoined twins who are plucked from their family by an impresario in order to form a rock band.<br /><br />almost deliberately gimmicky, the film is also too clever by half (if you'll pardon the pun). by mixing genres, styles and moods, the directors (whose previous film was the excellent documentary lost in la mancha) lose their way pretty quickly. i was never sure whether i was meant to take it all seriously or not. flashbacks, dream sequences, it was all just a bit much. plus, the promised rock and roll just didn't move me. i was reminded a bit too much at times of hedwig and the angry inch, a film i found original and moving. but in this case, the songs just weren't as good, nor were the main characters sympathetic. a more unfavourable comparison would be the similarly disappointing velvet goldmine.	1
this is quite possibly the worst movie of all time. it stars shaquille o'neil and is about a rapping genie. apparently someone out there thought that this was a good idea and got suckered into dishing out cash to produce this wonderful masterpiece. the movie gets 1 out of 10.	1
would someone tell shaq to stick to what he is good at basketball. this movie was not even entertaining on a stupid level. in this movie shaq plays a genie who lives in a boom box is that not orginal a genie in a boom box instead of a lamp. he is supposed to help a little boy played by the equally annoying francais cappra. this movie had the most flimsy storyline since water world, the acting was awful and i think that anyone who likes this flim would be afraid to admit it.	1
"this film proves that the ""commercial"" cinema ,or else,the hollywood movies are in a serious crisis.there is absolutely no reason that this movie should have been produced apart from the fact that somebody expected success based on shaquille's name.there is no worth referring to the plot :it is a bit more perplexed than a knot.what else?the screen is somewhat dim,o'neal is a bad actor but francis capra is even worse.<br /><br />rating: 1 / 10."	1
"there was a genie played by shaq his name was kazaam, and he was whack his rhymes were corny, this lines were bad some stupid kid cryin over his stupid dad bad actin, bad casting, bad special effects whats next? this movie sucks prolly didn't make 20 bucks he lives in a boombox not a lamp hurts like a cramp like a wet food stamp...<br /><br />yeah, you get it, a stupid rhyming genie who can't act, in a stupid movie with horrible special effects. oh, and its confusing as hell. i'm not even gonna go on. let's just say, it belongs in the ""its so bad, its funny"" category. watch it once with your buddies and get a good laugh. but don't expect anything spectacular."	1
"yes, kazaam is one of those horribly bad movies that almost reminds one of everything that is wrong with not just kids movies, but with humanity. here we have shaq as a rapping genie- yes, a rapping genie- where he does everything from making bad puns to dressing in ridiculous outfits, all ending in him in a christ-like pose with lots of light surrounding him. so, yeah, expect really cheesy bits, including the first wish being a lot of junk food falling down from the sky (and, regrettably, not knocking out the two main characters, particularly the kid). what might not be expected is that a film with a kid and shaquille o'neill would be so incredibly schmaltzy! the main plot of the film involves this kid, played in that all-too-typical and annoying-kid fashion by the great-grandson of frank capra (where in which the kid is yelling out his dialog angrily), who comes upon a genie who's been trapped in a boom-box. then ""hiarity ensues"" as the kid makes the shaq-genie his quasi-slave as he waits on his last two wishes as he tries to make amends with his shady-gang-type absentee father.<br /><br />this really sappy, contrived son and father story would be bad enough, as there are certain lines that have been uttered in a million other movies (i.e. the ""two chances in life"" speech from father to son). but it's shaquille o'neill who is both the reason to watch the film (ironically), and the obvious sinking crux of it all. his plot line involves him, when not getting the over-talky treatment from capra, to rap within the dialog and also start off his blossoming recording career. on top of this, he also kicks ass and takes names with the main bad guys who want him back in the boom-box. so is there a camp factor to the movie? up to a point, but this is even squashed by all of the mushy scenes and 'heart-felt' moments that have really no business with the rest of the material. one might ask if the people making the movie, who were obviously doing it at the behest of the popularity of a basketball player who wanted to go on the michael jordan acting bandwagon, if it would be anywhere near decently entertaining or convincing. i'd hope that they too knew they were just getting paid. but i'd hope even more that they felt at least a little guilty afterwords for feeding the shaq-machine.<br /><br />so, if you want to have a fun night of shaq as genie-turned-rapper-turned-wisecracker, all the more fun to you. hell, it might even be interesting to have a shaq movie night with this and his other critically acclaimed effort steel. but if you're hoping to keep a few brain cells, stay away from what is very likely the worst flick of 1996, and a candidate among many others for worst of the 90's."	1
this movie is so, so, so horrible, that it makes angels lose their wings. shaq had tried to make other crossover efforts, like his work in shaq-fu for the nes and his plethora of unbearable rap albums, and later, the epic serving of horrible film-making that is steel.<br /><br />there's not a single good thing to be said about this movie. i saw it a bunch of times when i was very young, but i must've been an idiot then, because this movie takes all that is enjoyable about films and tears it apart. it's fun to mock. i saw it on the disney channel a while back and spent a few minutes doing that. although, once the thrill of mocking it is done, you still become overwhelmed by its terribleness.<br /><br />if you see it on tv, try this: consider, as your watching the film, removing from it all the scenes in which shaq uses his magical genie powers. if you do that, it becomes like a film about a pedophile chasing a kid and rapping to seduce him. that's kinda funny, and disturbing.<br /><br />a horrible example of film. do not, unless looking to mock it, see this movie.	1
i feel like i'm the only kid in town who was annoyed by branagh's performance. he is a fine actor by most accounts, but he simply could not pull off the southern accent. i mean, it was deplorable. it was as if he was trying too hard to be a yank. one of the previous reviewers questioned why u.s. actors were not cast in this film. i second that notion. it's wonderful when actors/actresses wish to expand their horizons, but it's another thing to try too hard so that a performance becomes strained. maybe it was altman, but he's a such a great director...<br /><br />well, i really don't want to bash branagh for his absolutely hideous accent too much. everybody deserves to screw up here and there. but it is hard to watch something so annoying that you'd rather choke on a chicken bone or eat a bucket full of crap than sit through the gingerbread man.	1
"if the crew behind ""zombie chronicles"" ever read this, here's some advice guys: <br /><br />1. in a ""twist ending""-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of every death in the movie in the opening credits. that tends to spoil the twists, y'know...? <br /><br />2. i know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. joe haggerty, i'm looking at you...<br /><br />3. if you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time.<br /><br />4. twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the ""reveal"" as soon as you introduce a character? that's not a great idea.<br /><br />kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, i'd rather they hadn't...<br /><br />only for zombie completists."	1
"what was the point of this movie? what was the plot? i do not know. shaq can't act, people don't know how to direct, and i am kazaam! a genie who raps? come on. maybe eminem or linkin park will be in a movie like this. i remember i watched this just to kill time. it didn't really interest me. i just remember thinking, ""who put shaq in this movie???"" the whole story seemed stupid too. it made no sense whatsoever. i guess an unrealized moral of this movie is that you can find anything in the ghetto and anything can happen. i can't comment much more because this movie is so terrible there's nothing worth commenting about. i ""wish"" this movie would go away."	1
"now, i'm one to watch movies that got poor reviews, and say, ""hmm... this isn't so bad!"" i loved the cable guy, and thought that my big fat independent movie was great. keep in mind, i really didn't start watching this with high hopes, but i figured that maybe... just maybe... it would be bad in a kind of way i could laugh at it. i was wrong. at no point at all during my suffering through this ""film"" (and i use that term sparingly) was i even close to being mildly entertained. to start, shaq makes quentin tarantino look like marlon brando when it comes to acting. i hate rap music, but as far as i could tell, an amish priest would probably make a better rapper than him. the main character is simply annoying, and not a character that it's easy to like. quite frankly, i would rather eat a greasy turd out of a harlequin fetus' bloody sores than watch this again."	1
let me give a quick summery of the film: a rotten, rude kid named max stumbles upon a radio that contains kazaam: a rapping genie. like all genies, he grants 3 wishes but, being good natured, also helps max with his personal life, as he has to deal with bullies and a father mixed up in organized crime. during all this, kazaam raps from time to time, (also showcasing shaq's dismal rap skills).<br /><br />this movie proves what we all know: athletes need to stick to sports. i admit that it never looked like an oscar-worthy movie, but everything about this waste of film is horrible. the characters are either unlikable or stupid, the plot is not even worth mentioning, the dialog is a joke, and shaq is only a quarter of the problem. hell, even if denzel washington played kazaam this movie would still be a joke. i know that the movie only drew anybody was because shaq was so big (no pun intended) at the time. i honestly cannot think of a single positive thing to say about this waste of time. shaq should have put the time had used to make this movie toward practicing free throws.	1
ok so after watching this invigorating movie and wasting an hour and so many minutes off my life here is the basic summary: genie comes out of ghetto boom box, gives this kid with shaggy hair 3 wishes, the kid wastes his wishes on i forget what, shaq sucks at rapping, and i guess thats it.<br /><br />so mainly i laughed, i cried......but mainly i laughed at the shear comedy that came from the wonderful acting skills of an nba player/rapper and boy with shaggy hair.<br /><br />i highly recommend this movie for college kids sitting around drinking some beers with their close friends and are in serious need of a good laugh.<br /><br />i'm going to give it a 3 out of 10 only b/c the movie is based off of 3 magical wishes.<br /><br />if i had 3 wishes one would be to erase this horrible movie and for everyone to pretend like hollywood didn't waste money on making this.	1
"reviewing kazaam and saying it's a bad movie isn't hard at all--after all, critics at the time it came out fell all over themselves excoriating this film--saying it was among the worst films of the decade! so the fact that i say it's bad or anyone else says it's bad is certainly no surprise. it's like someone talking about wwii--practically no one says that was a good thing, right?! the question i have and no place on imdb can answer it is ""why did they make this in the first place?!"". after all, it's obvious to anyone who isn't severely brain injured that the film would be horrible. but, movies like ed (a baseball playing chimp), cool as ice (starring the ever-popular vanilla ice), troll 2 (which doesn't even have any trolls in it), baby geniuses (einstain-like superhero babies) and pinocchio in outer space (huh!?!) prove that any idea, no matter how dumb, can make it to the big screen! so, the idea of the best basketball player of the time starring as a genie to an obnoxious little brat seems downright 'normal'! <br /><br />the film starts with a kid who is pretty jerky keying the lockers in the hallway of the school. like the punk from free willy, this kid is somehow 'misunderstood' (in other words, a total brat) and you know that no matter how selfish and horrible he is, by the end of the film he'll have learned something and grown. just once, i want to see a punk kid like this end up in prison or or dead by the end of the film! eventually, while the neighborhood bullies are in the middle of pummeling him, the genie kazaam (shaquille o'neal)is accidentally released and insists on giving the brat three wishes. but, the kid doesn't believe him and the genie's magic seems a tad rusty.<br /><br />eventually the brat does realize that kazaam is for real. however, unlike most kids, he withholds making his wishes so, in the meantime, kazaam is forced to follow him around everywhere--like his own personal servant. and, according to the cliché, you know that by the end of the film, max and kazaam will have become lifelong buddies and a bunch of tears will be shed. oh, and max will have come to terms with his absent father and mom's fiancé (i'm gonna gag). apparently this genie is a bit of a social worker in addition to being a granter of wishes.<br /><br />as for kazaam, shaquille speaks in rhyme through much of the movie and even takes a break to rap...very poorly. i'm a middle-aged white guy and i think i could probably rap at least as well! he's an amazing basketball player and i've heard he's a nice guy--but a rapper...no way! as far as his acting goes, he wasn't great but had such a nice personality in the film that it's hard to hate him--even if they made him do a lot of very stupid things.<br /><br />so is the movie as excruciatingly awful as you've probably heard? through the first two-thirds of the movie, i would have said no. shaquille seemed to try his best with an unlikable kid and a bad script. however, later in the film, the bad becomes horrid--as kazaam seems too concerned with himself to help the kid when he's really needed. and, out of nowhere, the plot gets really, really weird--as the guy who wants to make kazaam a rap star(?!?!) turns out to be an evil mobster! and, oddly, this guy seems to accept that kazaam is a genie with no hesitation! <br /><br />in addition, the last portion of the film consists of people trying to kill max and his dad. i know that the kid was annoying, but this is supposed to be a kids' film!! what part of 'trying to kill the kid' didn't the writers not understand?!? then, in an ending that makes this perhaps the worst kids film ending in history, kazaam becomes god or something and it all was like a drug-induced hallucination! this ending was even dumber and weirder than the one in the black hole...and boy, did it make my brain hurt!! uggghh--the horrible dialog was just too much to bear!!!<br /><br />overall, it's a terrible film that is due mostly to writers who were certifiably insane. yes, folks, with a messed up message, bizarre non-kid friendly material and horrible characters, this is one wretched film. sadly, given the idea and actors, it's hard to imagine the final product turning out much worse!!<br /><br />by the way, if you want to see a genie in a modern world film that is good, try the british made for tv film ""bernard and the genie""--a charming and exceptionally well-written film from start to finish."	1
"the only reason i dvrd this movie was because 1. i live in cleveland and shaq plays basketball for us now and 2. i've always heard how awful it was. the movie did not disappoint. the best parts were shaq's outfits. the worst parts were, well, just about everything else. my 12 year old son and i just squirmed and couldn't look at the screen when shaq started rapping and we kept wondering why max didn't wish for kazzam to fix that front tooth of his! but for all it's terribleness we just couldn't stop watching it, the story sucked you in, like a black hole or quicksand or a tar pit, it was hypnotic. but it was worth it for the laughs and just to say that we actually watched ""kazzam""."	1
if you are a fan of really bad movies, and you think there funny, you will the great acting of shaq. first off putting pro players in movies hardly ever works. shaq had to of been the worst actor i have ever seen next to dennis rodman who also made a few bad movies. well any way this movie is also bad due to the hideous kid. i would give this a zero but that is impossible.	1
"this movie has successfully proved what we all already know, that professional basket-ball players suck at everything besides playing basket-ball. especially rapping and acting. i can not even begin to describe how bad this movie truly is. first of all, is it just me, or is that the ugliest kid you have ever seen? i mean, his teeth could be used as a can-opener. secondly, why would a genie want to pursue a career in the music industry when, even though he has magical powers, he sucks horribly at making music? third, i have read the bible. in no way shape or form did it say that jesus made genies. fourth, what was the deal with all the crappy special effects? i assure you that any acne-addled nerdy teenager with a computer could make better effects than that. fifth, why did the ending suck so badly? and what the hell is a djin? and finally, whoever created the nightmare known as kazaam needs to be thrown off of a plane and onto the eiffel tower, because this movie take the word ""suck"" to an entirely new level."	1
i was given the book version of kazaam for my 8th birthday, and people always say the book versions are always better than the movie, but this time they were wrong. at least with the movie it's over soon.<br /><br />the acting in this is terrible, which i expected from a film with shaq who plays a magical rapping genie that comes out of an old ghetto blaster (which there was probably a good reason he was trapped in there). the kid in the film that plays max is whiny and a terrible actor. he's bullied by neighborhood kids, which i don't blame them because he's a little douche bag.<br /><br />the story is just plain stupid and extremely cliché. about a boy who's father is always working and never around who finds a new friend who makes his life better and eventually helps him reconnect with his father.<br /><br />even at 8 years old i thought this was a stupid idea. it's a surprise any of the people whom worked on this film had careers after wards because it's an embarrassment and should have never been made. i could ramble on even more about how this movie sucks, but you should already know just by reading the plot.	1
this is the worst film i have ever seen.i was watching this film with some friends and after 40 minutes we had enough. the plot was bad and there wasn't a single likeable character.i could get more entertainment watching static. i gave this movie a 1 only because the scale didn't go into negative numbers. avoid this movie at all costs.	1
there's only one thing i need to say about this movie - the scene where shaq is in a musical number with francis capra's character about wanting to be a genie; never see this movie. the story is horrible, the acting is terrible (c'mon, it's shaq!) and i'd rather see capra in free willy (equally horrible) twice before ever seeing this movie.	1
this is one of the most god-awful movies ever. shaq better just stick to basketball. this movie took away apart of my life i will never have back. i will make fun of this movie until i die, and then some. it is so horrible it is not even funny. mst3000 would have a blast with this one.	1
what a pathetic movie.<br /><br />i won't waste much time commenting about it. i'm still trying to get back the couple hours i wasted on it.<br /><br />let me leave it simply with - shaq has no business being an actor or singer. he is utterly without talent at both discplines. it's a crying shame that substantially more talented people waste away in community theatres and karaoke bars while shaq uses his name as a basketball player to undeservedly get cast in movies and cut cds.<br /><br />much of the failure of this movie was the pathetic no-talent that is shaq.	1
"the first half of this version was the best i've seen (and i think i've seen every version of jane eyre ever made). the development of jane's childhood and character were exceptional. then, it was as though someone said ""uh oh, this is running too long,"" and hacked the rest of the story to shreds. the major scenes, when included at all, are glossed over, combined, and put out of order in such a way that they completely change the storyline. there was so little transition or even scene development that it would be difficult for anyone not familiar with the story even to follow. the big disappointment was that the beginning opened so much hope, and then the end dashed it."	1
"as a ""jane eyre"" fan i was excited when this movie came out. ""at last,"" i thought, ""someone will make this book into a movie following the story actually written by the author."" wrong!!! if the casting director was intending to cast a ""jane"" who was plain he certainly succeeded. however, surely he could have found one who could also act. where was the tension between jane and rochester? where was the spooky suspense of the novel when the laughter floated into the night seemingly from nowhere? where was the sparkle of the child who flirted and danced like her mother? finally, why was the plot changed at the end? one wonders whether the screenwriters had actually read the book. what a disappointment"	1
"i love the book, ""jane eyre"" and have seen many versions of it. all have their strong points and their faults. however, this was one of the worst i have seen. i didn't care about jane or mr. rochester. charlotte gainsbourg (jane) was almost tolerable and certainly looked the plain part, but she had no emotion in any of her lines. i couldn't imagine what mr. rochester saw in her. <br /><br />that brings us to mr. rochester. william hurt had even less emotion than jane, if that were possible. how two such insipid people could fall in love is a mystery, but it certainly didn't hold my attention. perhaps the director (zeffrelli) fell asleep during the production.<br /><br />the timothy dalton (too handsome for mr. rochester!) version is far more faithful to the book, but ciaran hinds plays the perfect mr. rochester in the 1997 a/e version (which is not all that true to the book).<br /><br />trying to find something positive about this movie: geraldine chaplain was perfect in her role."	1
oh just what i needed,another movie about 19th century england. which is pretty much like regular england,only nobody's vandalising football stadiums.in this picturesque setting of lords,dames and other randomly chosen titles,charlotte gainsbourg walks around aimlessly as jane eyre,from that novel nobody has ever read willingly.jane usually hangs out in mr.rochester's crib,where she tries to teach a french girl to look at an empty chalkboard all the time.one day,mr.rochester(william hurt on auto-pilot)comes back to fall in love with jane and all that,but there's still the matter of his fruitcake wife that is locked in the attic.oops,that wasn't in the brochure.after some people being thrown around and some carefully spread fire(they probably rented the set),the movie finally comes to an end.everything looked really authentic,that's something i guess.but then again,nah.	1
this 1996 movie was the first adaptation of jane eyre that i ever watched and when i did so i was appalled by it. so much of the novel had been left out and i considered william hurt to be terribly miscast as rochester. since then i have watched all the other noteworthy adaptations of the novel, the three short versions of '44, '70 and '97 and the three mini series of '73, '83 and 2006, and i have noticed that there are worse adaptations and worse rochesters.<br /><br />this is without doubt the most exquisite jane eyre adaptation as far as cinematography is concerned. director franco zerifferelli revels in beautiful long shots of snow falling from a winter sky, of lonely rochester standing on a rock, and of jane looking out of the window - but he is less good at telling a story and bringing characters to life. in addition, his script merely scratches the surface of the novel by leaving out many important scenes. as a consequence the film does not show the depth and complexity of the relationship between jane and rochester, and sadly it does also not include the humorous side of their intercourse. there are a number of short conversations between rochester and jane, each of them beautifully staged, but the couple of sentences they exchange do not suffice to show the audience that they are drawn to each other. we know that they are supposed to fall in love, but we never see it actually happen. the scene in which rochester wants to find out jane's reaction to his dilemma by putting his case in hypothetical form before her after the wounded mason has left the house is completely missing, and the farewell scene, the most important scene - the climax - of the novel is reduced to four sentences. zerifferelli does not make the mistake other scriptwriters have made in substituting their own poor writing for brontë's superb lines, neither are crucial scenes completely changed and rewritten, but he makes the less offensive but in the end similarly great mistake of simply leaving many important scenes out. what remains is just a glimpse of the novel, which does no justice to charlotte brontë's masterpiece.<br /><br />the cast is a mixed bag: while fiona shaw is an excellent mrs reed, anna paquin's young jane is more an ill-mannered, pout lolita than a lonely little girl, longing for love. the ever-reliable joan plowright makes a very likable, but far too shrewd mrs fairfaix, and one cannot help feeling that billie whitelaw is supposed to play the village witch instead of plain-looking, hard-working grace poole. charlotte gainsbourgh as the grown-up heroine, however, is physically a perfect choice for playing jane eyre. looking every bit like 18, thin and frail, with irregular, strong features, she comes closest to my inner vision of jane than any other actress in that role. and during the first 15 minutes of her screen time i was enchanted by her performance. gainsbourgh manages well to let the audience guess at the inner fire and the strong will which are hidden behind the stoic mask. but unfortunately the script never allows her to expand the more passionate and lively side of jane's character any further. as a result of leaving out so many scenes and shortening so much of the dialogues, gainsbourgh's portrayal of jane must necessarily remain incomplete and therefore ultimately unsatisfactory. this is a pity, as with a better script charlotte gainsbourgh might have been as good a jane as zelah clarke in the '83 version.<br /><br />but while it is still obvious that gainsbourgh is trying to play jane, there is no trace whatsoever of rochester in the character that william hurt portrays. hurt, who has proved himself to be a fine actor in many good movies, must have been aware that he was physically and type-wise so miscast that he did not even attempt at playing the rochester of the novel. his rochester, besides being blond and blue-eyed, is a soft-spoken, well-mannered nobleman, shy and quiet, slightly queer and eccentric, but basically good-natured and mild. he is so far from being irascible, moody and grim that lines referring to these traits of his character sound absolutely ridiculous. additionally, during many moments of the movie, hurt's facial expression leaves one wondering if he is fighting against acute attacks of the sleeping sickness. particularly in the proposal scene he grimaces like a patient rallying from a general anaesthetic and is hardly able to keep his eyes open. if you compare his rochester to the strong-willed and charming protagonist of the novel, simply bursting with energy and temperament, it is no wonder that many viewers are disappointed in hurt's performance. still, he offends me less than the rochesters in the '70, '97 and 2006 versions and i would in general rank this jane eyre higher than these three other ones. hurt obviously had the wits to recognise that he could not be the rochester of the novel and therefore did not try to do so, whereas george c. scott, ciaràn hinds and toby stephens thought they could, but failed miserably, and i'd rather watch a character other than rochester than a rochester who is badly played. and i'd rather watch a jane eyre movie which leaves out many lines of the novel but does not invent new ones than a version which uses modernised dialogues which sound as if they could be uttered by a today's couple in a starbucks café. of course this jane eyre is a failure, but at least it is an inoffensive one, which is more than one can say of the '97 and 2006 adaptations. i would therefore not desist anyone from watching this adaptation: you will not find jane eyre, but at least you will find a beautifully made movie.	1
"having read the novel before seeing this film, i was enormously disappointed by the wooden acting and the arrogance of the producers in their blatant disregard of the plot. i feel this film in no way reflects the brilliance of bronte's work, and rather gave the impression of a shallow love story. in the condensing of the film to a short 2hours, the film lost many of the key features which make the book comprehendable and progressional, thus resulting in a somewhat jumpy plot with little grounding. there is no build up to the romance between rochester and jane eyre, so this appears rather abrupt and unfounded since the two characters have such infrequent interaction you cannot help but imagine their 'love' is superficial. this is such an injustice to bronte's novel;you are given no impression of jane's quirky cheek and boldness which attracts rochester to her, and his arrogance which attracts jane to him.<br /><br />despite to poor scripting, i think that a few of the characters were portrayed very astutely, namely mrs fairfax and grace poole, however overall the production was poor. given a better scripting, perhaps the film would have been more successful. see ""jane eyre"" (1970) with zelah clarke and timothy dalton for an outstanding production."	1
i agree with one of the other comment writers about good story & good actors but mismatched, and i would also say rushed. it has been about 24years since i read the book as it was in school. but i felt that you would need to know the story of jane eyre when watching this one as bits are left out & therefore it doesn't fully make sense. for example jane & mr rochester have hardly spoken & suddenly he is proposing marriage!!! the actors don't have time to let the audience know how their character feels about each thing happening in the story.the actors are good but aren't given enough time to do this story justice. i'm sorry to say it but i didn't really enjoy this version.the 1970 version with susanna york & george c scott would be the jane eyre movie of my preference but you should check out the 1983 bbc mini series version with zelah clarke & timothy dalton in the 2 main roles. i love it so much i watch it regularly.there is an abridged version which goes for 225mins or the full version for 330mins.	1
there is not a single sympathetic character in this entire movie. is it the lawyer played by kenneth branagh that we're supposed to be pulling for? well, let's see -- we learn he's a sleazebag defense attorney who gets criminals off on technicalities. he treats his coworkers like cattle, gets them involved in his own personal crisis (in the process, getting one of them killed), jeopardizes the safety of his kids, threatens his ex-wife's new boyfriend, tries to strong-arm the police and school administrators -- and all this for what? because he was thinking with his little head! i was really pulling for the father and his gang to beat the stuffing out of the lawyer and drown him in the swamp...it would have made for a far more satisfying ending.	1
"what was franco zeffirelli thinking? was hollywood responsible for this travesty, or can i take comfort in the idea that someone who didn't speak english as a first language just completely missed the point of charlotte bronte's classic? i don't think i can improve on a comment i read below, so i'll just paraphrase it: ""jane eyre is a great great book, the screenwriter should read it sometime."" it's true that this movie's two leads were sadly miscast. but pity the actors, because the screenwriter left out all of the best scenes. the dialog that makes you understand the jane and rochester have a meeting of minds and a shared sense of fun...deleted from the script. the marriage proposal, the fortune teller...gone. the allusions, half joking, half sincerely felt, to jane as a fairy sprite from olde england come to rescue rochester in his despair...eliminated.<br /><br />it is unfortunate that zeffirelli felt the need to completely rewrite the end of the novel and jane's interactions with the rivers family. but it is unforgivable that he has surgically removed the love from one of the best love stories ever written.<br /><br />do yourself a favor and go find the 1983 (?) mini series with timothy dalton."	1
i read the novel 'jane eyre' for the first time back in 1986. it was round that time that i saw the bbc-version with timothy dalton and zelah clarke. it was an excellent version and very much like the book. years later, i laid eyes on this version and was horrified. william hurt is totally miscast as mr rochester. mr rochester is a passionate character, where as william hurt portrays him as a block of ice. the same goes for charlotte gainsborough. it was like watching two zombies together. this is story about love and passion, but i couldn't see it in this version. no, back to the bbc-version. a wonderful time is guaranteed.	1
jane eyre_ is one of the greatest novels in the english language and this screenwriter should of read it. i hate it when writers use spark notes for what a novel is all about. this movie is unbearable to watch if you have read the book.<br /><br />the whole 'red room' is so down played that i wonder why they even bother to put it in. in the book the 'red room' is foreshadowing for the whole story and the rest of jane's life. helen burns is treated so badly in the movie i'm sure she was happy to die and leave early. in the book she is one of the most compelling characters and she was not the red head. the whole christian theme is missing from her life and the rest of the movie.<br /><br />do yourself a favor and miss this movie and read the story as charlotte bronte masterfully told it.	1
"i don't like using the word ""awful"" to describe any work of the cinema for which a great deal of time, effort, talent and money is spent in its creation but zefferelli's attempt to adapt charlotte brontë's novel 'jane eyre' is a total waste of time.<br /><br />the script is lacking in finesse and power, everything explained to the viewer in no uncertain terms, leaving little to the imagination. the lead actors are woefully miscast, clearly hired for their star names, and the musical score drippy and dull. charlotte gainsbourg and william hurt have absolutely no chemistry with one another at all. she is like a wet noodle, worse even than joan fontaine, who at least was capable of some modicum of emotional involvement in what should be a story of frustrated passion. and william hurt acts the entire film on one tone and that tone is flat and devoid of energy. of course the limp and vapid script does not aid any of these otherwise fine actors in their efforts to bring any whiff of life to this flick.<br /><br />joan plowright's mrs fairfax is like some disney creation who keeps popping up to sweeten scenes in which she would have been best left out. <br /><br />there is no mystery surrounding the story of rochester's first wife. the role of the would-be second wife, played like a barbie doll by elle macphearson, is an empty cipher.<br /><br />fiona shaw, a very great actress, is completely wasted as jane's aunt, mrs reed. she would have been better-cast as mrs fairfax. only amanda root, as jane's beloved school teacher, evokes any authentic sympathy or believability. <br /><br />i saw this version of 'jane eyre' after viewing robert young's for british television, made in 1997, starring ciaran hinds, samantha morgan and gemma jones. there is no comparison. young's vital, romantic and deeply moving version is like an exploding nova compared to zefferelli's wet squib.<br /><br />i will be interested now to see the 1970 version with timothy dalton, about which i've read some very good things on this web-site. i am amazed at how many people liked zefferelli's yorkshire picture book. <br /><br />about all i can say good about this film is that the house is beautiful and the cinematography vividly colored, beyond that it is a complete dud."	1
this version is pretty insipid, i'm afraid. jane eyre is one of my favorite books and has been since childhood, but william hurt's weary, throwaway acting style is completely unsuitable to the bold passion of edward rochester and poor charlotte gainsbrough looks like a bored, petulant teenager whose dental braces hurt! i also can't believe that they eliminated edward's great marriage proposal scene from the end of the book, one of the most moving moments in literature. i do appreciate that they finally used such a young, plain woman to play jane, a character who is supposed to be a worldly 18, but if you want to see a version that closer approximates the personalities and passions of the novel, please see the 70's version with george c. scott and susannah york. york was too old, tall and pretty to play jane, but no one has touched rochester's character the way that scott did.	1
what made the idea of seeing this movie so attractive was the hope that it would live up to charlotte bronte's brilliance of the original classic story. i was deeply disappointed to find that this movie, which seemed to be either written or filmed in great haste, had not the qualities that made the original novel so powerful. much of the witty back and forth between the main characters, jane eyre and mr. rochester, seemed to be either missing from the screenplay or left on the cutting room floor. also missing was jane eyre's charismatic sense of self, which enabled her to suffer through her turmoil and triumph over all. the original jane eyre was a hero. the woman in this movie did not seem to have much to triumph over, including one of the greatest parts of the story when jane runs away from thornfield and mr. rochester. her struggle to find food and shelter, her shame at having to beg for bread, the threat of freezing to death in the cold, all to get away from a man she loved were, in my opinion, poignant parts of the story that were simply left out of this movie. the title character seemed dry and uninspired. the story was unappealing and for those who did not read the book, i cannot imagine that this story would be the least bit interesting. the screenplay and direction did little if any credit to the classic story.	1
"i can't say this is the worst film of all time, but only because there are still some movies i haven't seen, yet! this has to be the most pretentious attempt at making a movie of all time! the director suffers from the same issues he had with ""there will be blood"" (though he wasn't quite as bad in that film. the whole movie it feels like you're watching a guy trying to hard to impress beyond his abilities. it's like he sits in his little director's chair and thinks ""how would a great filmmaker handle this scene?"" he just doesn't have it in him. i don't know if this film could be saved by a great filmmaker. there were certainly some nuggets of greatness that could have been polished, but nothing was brought to ripen. the scene where all the characters are singing was the worst moment in cinema history. one by one as we see the characters singing, and i squirmed in my seat, i kept saying ""please, please, just don't have the guy on the brink of death singing, too!"" sure enough, massive failure!"	1
"this ambitious film suffers most from writer/director paul thomas anderson's delusions of grandeur. highly derivative of much better material (altman's ""nashville,"" lumet's ""network""), this lumbering elephant takes far too long to get nowhere. a couple of misguided detours along the way (an embarrassing musical interlude, a biblical plague) don't help matters. neither does the uneven level of performances. especially bad: william h. macy, whose character and storyline could easily have been eliminated altogether; julianne moore, for her unconvincing angst. and how many times must we see john c. reilly's sad sack shtick (""chicago"" and ""the hours"" will suffice)? tom cruise comes off well by comparison  his misogynist, foul-mouthed holy roller was rather amusing. speaking of foul mouths, the script was so loaded with ""f"" bombs, they lost their impact in no time. don't even talk about that awful soundtrack, full of insipid and annoying vocals by aimee mann. her extended rendition of ""one,"" a maudlin number to begin with, drove me to distraction at the start of the film. i should have heeded the handwriting on the wall and saved myself three more hours, by which time i'd been pushed to the brink of hell. one redeeming feature, which i haven't seen mentioned in other reviews, is the best performance in the bunch, by unknown melora walters in the role of claudia, the damaged coke fiend bent on self-destruction. her credibility exceeded all others by far. this film took itself way too seriously and just didn't know when to end."	1
magnolia presents itself as a wall to wall canvas of screaming, shrieking, overwrought, hysterical twits who are all bedeviled by regret, guilt and pain. pt anderson is certainly a gifted filmmaker but perhaps he should leave the writing to someone else or at least find someone with the balls to tell him he needed to edit this overlong mess.<br /><br />a look at the cast will tell you that the performances were excellent, and they were. i just wish that every scene didn't involve an over the top shouting match or long digression into the sins that have been committed and the pain that they have caused.<br /><br />i also think that anderson fails miserably to create a story that parallels the bizarre tableaus that open the film. the opening sequences are wonderful in showing how fate can bring together people and circumstances that even the most optimistic believer in a cosmic puppeteer pulling our strings would scoff at. but the story that then develops lacks any of the stuff that these opening fables display. i kept waiting for some form of cosmic convergence to display itself, but instead all we get is waves of regret from morally challenged characters who see their past spread out before them and now seek absolution. throw in an out of left field biblical plague near the end and all you end up with is a cadre of anderson devotees who will marvel at his genius when all it really proves is that he has actually read the old testament.<br /><br />i will say that the music by aimee mann was great and i'll be looking for the soundtrack cd. in short, a good movie to look at and listen to (the music, that is) if the actors would have shut up or toned it down it may have been	1
i think i've seen all of the grisham movies now and generally they're all very poor, except for the rainmaker, but this one is so bad it's unbelievable<br /><br />warning spoilerish<br /><br />it's one of those movies where the character does the stupid irrational things that no one would ever do. he's a lawyer for christ's sake. why when his children go missing does he not call the police. oh yes it's because all the police hate lawyers so they're just ignore him and let him be attacked.<br /><br />when he's arrested for murder they just let him go free, he would be locked up in a cell pending a bail hearing. <br /><br />why would you drag your kids halfway across the country when you could easily protect them at home.<br /><br />the police don't bother to try and find an escaped mental patient, they don't bother to interview his daughter.<br /><br />as for the ridiculous ending.<br /><br />in summary, silly, very unrealistic and a complete waste of time.<br /><br />0/10  one of the worst films ever made.	1
1999 will go down in history as the year the movie critic lead the general public astray. first they sent us to eyes wide shut. then they hyped up the blair witch project and now magnolia which is by far the worst movie of the year. what is it about? who the heck knows. its full of self-indulgence and loaded with bad acting. i always like to stay and watch the credits, but when this thing was over i couldn't get out of the movie theatre fast enough. most of the audience that attended the showing that i was at, felt pretty much the same way. dates were arguing with each other as well as strangers. it's an ugly and hateful film that will make you feel ugly and hateful.	1
"my guess is that this director/writer had something to say. let's see, what it could have been... a. frog storms would be creepy? b. can i get someone like tom cruise to say the ""c"" word many times and look like a bad patrick rafter? c. cast my wife and get her to say the ""f"" word every 2 seconds. this aside i really liked the beginning and the frog storm. the rest was a relentless, over-long (under-edited), over-indulgent failure. glad so many of you enjoyed it! <br /><br />"	1
normally i dont have a problem with gratuitous swearing in films, but this one really annoyed me. all they did was swear. for the whole film. (and, as someone else noted, get cancer) it was boring, rambling and pretentious. i wouldnt if i were you. <br /><br />its also not that i dont like films which, as most people who like it will claim 'observe life'. i love eat drink man woman, and all that happens in that is that a load of taiwanese people lead their lives. but i could relate to them. i have never met anyone who swore as much as the 'actors' in this film, and i used to work on a construction site. so go figure. having said that william h. macy made me grin. once. <br /><br />2/10. avoid, unless you enjoy tedium.	1
i wanted to like magnolia. the plot reminded me of grand canyon (which i liked). 4 different lives/stories that come together at the end but magnolia took a wrong turn halfway through the movie and i was lost. i almost turned it off right then and there but i felt i should hang in there until the end, little did i know it would be another torturous 1 1/2 hours. thank god i rented instead of seeing it in the theatre. i almost screamed out in frustration after 2 hours. the biggest kick in the pants was the ending frog scene. my dvd player still hasn't forgiven me and i don't blame it one bit. it was a unique movie, but a bad, boring, and pointless movie.	1
"sorry did i miss something? did i walk out early? the first ten minutes of unusual (and untrue!) stories had me thinking ""this is going to be a classic"" but it was all down hill from there! the acting was brilliant, for what it's worth william h macy is fantastic and just gets better and better every film i watch him in. but it never seemed to connect. i was waiting for the big moment where all the stories inter connect and then suddenly..it rains frog?? it was if the writer said ""i've gone to deep how can i pull all these stories together cleverely....oh sod it i'll just have it raining frogs"". i like clever movies, i like strange movies but this was just odd and boring. 4/10"	1
great cast. great acting. unpredictable story line for the first half<br /><br />hour or so. i was really wanting to know what was going to<br /><br />happen to each of these unredeeming characters, and how their<br /><br />seemingly disparate lives would become intertwined. but when<br /><br />the writers took out the glue to start connecting the players, they<br /><br />mistakenly used super glue and brought the movie to a standstill<br /><br />for the last two hours. i kept thinking it would get better, but it only<br /><br />got worse. don't believe the reviews. this is a waste of time. <br /><br />think about it -- tom cruise made ugly -- why? the gorgeous<br /><br />hunky bartender wearing braces -- why? i know it had to do with<br /><br />the plot, but without them, at least there would have been one<br /><br />attractive cast member to remember.	1
"magnolia"" is a preposterous, bewildering acting showcase that adds up to very little. like ""eyes wide shut,"" ""magnolia"" is an aimless series of episodes without any concern for coherence. the camera swoops through hallways and corridors, catching glimpses of sad characters. where is the reason to care for these people? the common theme seems to be people who yell a lot, who can't care for others (except for john c. reilly's and philip seymour hoffman's characters), and are self-destructive jerks who are either falling to pieces or dying. i was reminded of how much i disliked ""shine"" because of the irredeemable monster of a father played by armin mueller-stahl. there are so many unattractive, unappealing characters here, why would we want to spend time with them?<br /><br />having said that, there is nothing held back about ""magnolia."" paul thomas anderson's ideas are splashed onto his canvas with abandon. there are two ideas in particular that bomb. both happen in the last hour of this 188-minute film. one has the camera flipping from one character to another while each one sings one of aimee mann's coffeehouse folk songs. sweet, but ineffectual since we can't see what strings them all together. the other idea i refer to cannot be revealed other than to say it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculous.<br /><br />""magnolia"" has a lot of great acting. particularly tom cruise who unleashes a performance i didn't know he had in him. and john c. reilly plays maybe the most decent and truly good cop in recent memory. but it all adds up to nothing. when the secret unexpected event happened, a girl behind me in the theatre couldn't hold it in any more and said, ""this is stupid!"" my feeling is the majority of moviegoers will agree.	1
i can't tell you how angry i was after seing this movie. the characters are not the slightest bit interesting, and the plot is non-existant. so after waiting to see how the lives of these characters affected each other, hoping that the past 2 and a half hours were leading up to some significant finish, what do we get??? a storm of frogs. now yes, i understand the references to the bible (exodus) and the underlying theme, but first of all, it was presented with absolutely no resolution, and second of all it would be lost to anyone who has not read the bible (a significant portion of the population) or charles fort (a still larger portion). as a somewhat well read person, i thought this movie was a self indulgent poor imitation of a seinfeld episode.<br /><br />don't waste your time. it would be better spent reading...<br /><br />...well anything to be honest	1
the minute you give an 'art film' 1/10, you have people baying for your ignorant, half-ass-ed, artistically retarded blood. i won't try and justify how i am not an aesthetically challenged retard by listing out all the 'art house cinema' i have liked or mentioning how i gave some unknown 'cult classic' a 10/10. all i ask is that someone explain to me the point, purpose and message of this film.<br /><br />here is how i would summarize the film: opening montage of three unrelated urban legends depicting almost absurd levels of co-incidence. this followed by (in a nutshell, to save you 3 hours of pain) the following - a children's game show host dying of lung cancer tries to patch things up with his coke-addicted daughter, who he may or may not have raped when she was a child, and who is being courted by a bumbling police officer with relationship issues, while the game-show's star contestant decides that he doesn't want to be a failed child prodigy, a fate which has befallen another one of the game show contestants from the 60s, who we see is now a jobless homosexual in love with a bartender with braces and in need of money for 'corrective oral surgery', while the game show's producer, himself dying of lung cancer, asks his male nurse to help him patch up with the son he abandoned years ago, and who has subsequently become a womanizing self help guru, even as mr. producer's second wife suffers from guilt pangs over having cheated a dying man; and oh, eventually, it rains frogs (you read correctly). and i am sparing you the unbelievably long and pointless, literally rambling monologues each character seems to come up with on the fly for no rhyme or reason other than, possibly, to make sure the film crosses 3 hours and becomes classified as a 'modern epic'. <br /><br />you are probably thinking that i could have done a better job of summarizing the movie (and in turn of not confusing you) if i had written the damn thing a little more coherently, maybe in a few sentences instead of just one... well, now you know how i feel.	1
this was shown on the biography channel and was about as informative as a children's comic! i gave it 2 out of 10 for it's attention to detail because for the most part it had a 70s feel to it and the three ladies that played the original three angels looked like them so the make-up was good.<br /><br />this was supposed to be a biography on the biography channel but it was void of everything that is normally / usually seen in one of their biographies. no interviews with surviving cast members, crew members, production team members etc., or their friends, families, and any biographers of those people. in fact i know just as much now about the programme as i did before i watched this film that was based on the (supposedly) biographical book. as for actually learning something that no-one knew about the program and wasn't common knowledge well that never happened.	1
this movie is like real life, by which i mean - not a lot happens in the available 2 hours or so, and not much game plan or plot is evidenced by the frequently invisible cast (their invisibility being due to the ""experimental"" lighting as mentioned by many reviewers). <br /><br />a big bore. no big surprise that altman helms this - he is a very variable performer (yes we all loved ""gosford park"", but ""pret a porter"" anyone? kansas city? dr t. and the women? aaargh), but the fact that the raw material is a john grisham tale, and the excellent cast that you will perceive through the gathering gloaming of your insistent slumber - makes this truly a masterpiece of bad film. and no, it is not ""so bad it's good"".<br /><br />it's just bad.	1
i happened to love the show growing up, along with millions of others. so i tuned in to this movie, thinking if not good it might be at least a bit dazzling and fun.<br /><br />wrong! i just have to wonder, at the end of this, was charlie's angels really that boring? i don't seem to remember it as such. but this movie, as bad as movies of this type can be, bore little resemblance to the excitement of that time period and show. i did see it all, in spite of the negatives, it wasn't unwatchable. but it was very bland, which i do not fault the performers for at all, particularly the women who played the angels as they really did look like them. the movie just wasn't that interesting. it tried to make each angel a ""character"". (one angel is to feisty, one is the ""good girl"", one is to into her husband....),all characters were portrayed with one major characteristic defining them and little depth beyond stereotypes. the excitement of the show was missing and the dialog was....dialog. that's pretty much it.<br /><br />not awful. not the worst of tv movies. but missable.	1
it was everything this isn't: it had pace, pop, and actors who weren't afraid to chew the scenery. it also had a decent script. this one had me scratching my head. if farrah isn't really ""serious"" about a career, why does she have a manager (and why is he wasting his time)? if kate and barney are ""artists,"" why do they sign up for the mother of all jiggle shows (like the ""brady bunch"" movie where robert reed wants to do shakespeare, only to find himself on bb)? they weren't industry names, but they weren't exactly starving, either. and while they got the history right (the poster was released before farrah got the show), silverman rejecting pitches for ""funniest home videos"" and ""american idol"" and spelling promising his baby girl tori someday he'll create a show for her obviously did not happen.<br /><br />what bothered me was how spelling's role is distorted. he's shown as the show-runner and creator when he was neither. and how he ""comes up"" with the ""idea"" for ca was is laughable!<br /><br />how were spelling and goldberg allowed to enforce farrah's oral contract when the others were signed? and why didn't farrah or bernstein tell them she was leaving not because she discovered her inner diva, but because majors wanted her to? this is why, when it tries tries to created conflict and tension by setting farrah up as the ""bad girl"" (like suzanne somers), it fails because the groundwork was never laid -- that was where the ""three's company"" pic delivered.	1
noting the cast, i recently watched this movie on tcm, hoping for an under-appreciated gem, as i regard many films from the 30's. this is no gem - not even semi-precious. the anachronistic clothing and 1930's rolls royce limo hit you immediately. the casting is strange, also. but mostly, there are too many dumb and unnecessary plot devices. this film has lots of good ingredients and a basic plot that holds promise, but the components aren't mixed according to the right recipe. it simply doesn't come together like it should. and that's a shame. with a few rather obvious, but minor alterations, this might have been a very good movie.<br /><br />the film is about an american showgirl (jean harlow) seeking a rich british husband - preferably from the nobility. she meets franchot tone and his buddy, who are on a lark in a rolls royce owned by his buddy's employer. harlow mistakenly assumes tone is the lord who owns the rolls, and she sets her sights on him. this early part of the film is a light comedy of no real distinction. <br /><br />however, tone unwittingly uncovers the fact that his employer is actually a german 5th columnist on the eve of wwi, and that is when the movie changes tone altogether and begins to fall apart. tone and harlow are married, but just as the honeymoon begins, he is gunned down by a mata hari-type (benita hume), and harlow flees the scene, with a bystander accusing her of tone's murder. (in fact, tone recovers from the wounds.)<br /><br />harlow flees to france, where she falls in love again - this time with a wealthy french cad (cary grant). tone, now in the army, and harlow are unexpectedly brought back together in grant's hospital room where he is in rehab from a plane crash. in the following scene, tone accuses harlow of abandoning him because she is essentially a gold-digger. harlow never explains about the witness' accusing her of murder and her panic! that is one of those unreal, movie-plot-device break-downs in the story.<br /><br />then tone is also brought back into contact with the woman (hume) who shot him. she is on hand to watch her paramour, grant, test the new plane that tone has delivered to him from england. incredibly, both hume and tone dimly recognize each other, but simply can't place where from! okay, so tone was shot and almost died; perhaps his memory is a little out of whack. but how many men did hume shoot that she would forget one of her marks? (she does not seem to be faking the memory lapse.)<br /><br />this is inexplicable and unnecessary. hume should have absolutely recognized him, but played it coy when she realized that tone wasn't able to place her. that would have been a much better treatment of that issue.<br /><br />the finale also is very unsatisfying. the movie, as made, has tone and harlow conspiring to preserve the good reputation of the cad, grant, leading to his fraudulent burial as a hero. then harlow and tone just walk away. it is noble to preserve the french public's perception of their national war hero, but very unsatisfying as a love story!<br /><br />what the film begs for is this: harlow explains that she fled in a panic in the face of accusations of murder; tone forgives her and quietly rekindles his love for her; he then carries a torch for her, even while helping her to rig the crash site to preserve grant's reputation. meanwhile, harlow finally recognizes grant for the cad he is. then having seen tone for the brave and noble man he is, harlow rekindles feelings for him, too. at film's end, the two of them become reconciled even as they work together to rig the appearance of grant's death. after grant's hero's burial, we see them embrace and kiss at the fade-out. that would have made a nice little movie. for cary grant fans, it would have been even better had tone played the french cad who is killed and grant the long-suffering first husband, reunited with harlow.<br /><br />it is incomprehensible that franchot tone is cast as the irishman living in england, while cary grant is cast as the frenchman. this movie would have been much better had they reversed roles. that also would have been more conducive to the film that should have been...	1
this may have been made for the hell of it, but it was most probably the worst film i've seen in years, the best thing about the entire dvd would be the case!!! i'm surprised that people took the time to make something so rubbish and yet spend money on it too, i'm glad i only rented. i suppose the real fans of this film would probably have to be sadistic and gothic to care about it without taking in any cgi or any other effects for that matter, i hope alex chandon learnt a lesson about lighting and sfx to make a better film in the future, that is, if he is still in work.<br /><br />notes to buyers this is extremely disappointing, don't buy it!!!!!	1
sadly,this is not 'the best british gore film since hellraiser', though the dvd cover claims this, which is what tricked me into buying it. it is, however, an homage to many of the great horrors of old, films from most notably the amicus stable.<br /><br />cradle... is shot on mini dv, which though we all know has more of a tv feel than a movie, can be done so much better. every scene, set and shot looks like it has been lit in exactly the same way (standard key, fill, rear setup), which only enhances the cheap look of the finished piece. the gore content is, quite frankly, laughable. from the opening shots where we see a man's obviously foam rubber head torn apart, through to tacky cheap prop hammers, the creature effects and the terrible cg, there was nothing in there that impressed me at all.<br /><br />the acting is abominable, from the near-comatose detective to the brummie dwarf, via dani filth, the least convincing horror movie bad guy i have ever witnessed. each of the substories is more formulaic than the last, and the sets get worse and worse as the movie runs. look out for the 'mental asylum' - a georgian semi detached house with a bad cg sign outside, and the most bizarre (and not in a good way) padded cell i have seen.<br /><br />it took me four attempts to get to the end of the film without my attention wandering (nay, running) away at any available opportunity. i actually found myself dusting at one point while the film was running.<br /><br />it does, however, mark one of the last known appearances of emily booth's breasts, which i guess is one (um, two) things it has going for it. once that's out of the way though, it is all downhill.<br /><br />i've heard people say good things about alex chandon, and i would love to believe them, but on this evidence i'm not likely to. if you want a decent homage to amicus, avoid this and go for the league of gentlemen christmas special instead.<br /><br />currently battling it out with blair witch 2: book of shadows for the title of worst film i have ever seen.	1
it surprisingly had a plot! ;) i've seen movies with less plot (i don't wanna mention asian movies but...). i thought the camera wasn't bad at all for a cheap movie like this, and also the atmosphere wasn't too bad. there is no real reason for most things people do and the way they react to what happens. although i do think that about a lot of movies, in this case it was horrible, of course.<br /><br />it ripped off some movies so badly just for single scenes. the acting was bad but i've seen worse. the movie was bad but i've seen worse. watching this film is an experience between boredom, laughing fits, death wish, sadism, horniness and entertainment on a low level.<br /><br />so if you like gory movies with stupid plots this one is the right film for you.<br /><br />i gave it 3/10, because it can be entertaining if you don't expect to see a good movie and you're in the right mood.	1
the directors cut version, which was the one i saw, was very long for this type of movie. almost two hours is way too long. if you have the choice, definitely go for the non-directors cut.<br /><br />the main plot is almost not taken up at all, the movie consists to the main part of several murder scenes, which are connected but the feeling is that they're only shown in order to fill the movie with splatterish violence. the connection is not revealed until the latter part and the lack of context bored me out long before i was there.<br /><br />as a horror movie it doesn't work. you never get the required feel for the characters due to mediocre acting and the general disposition (character is presented, 15 minutes later character is dead). this pictures strong side lies in the splatter part.	1
by all accounts, this could have been an interesting film. featuring a score by the mighty cradle of filth, starring their frontman dani and being hyped up as ""the future of british horror"", i expected alex chandon's gore fest to live up to the hype.<br /><br />i was wrong.<br /><br />everything about this film is either cliche or inept. the short story anthology setup was done to death (and much better) in the seventies and eighties. admittedly, the idea of 'the sick room' did send a chill down my spine, but as with most of the film was let down by bad script writing and acting.<br /><br />chandon cannot write dialogue. every sentence with the main police investigator is brim full with swearing and insolence (the typical 'cop on the edge' formula. funny, i'm sure i've seen that somewhere else before...) no chandon, you are not tarantino. or scorsese. it sounds bad. add ludicrously ott acting with very dodgy casting (don't get me wrong, dani filth is a great singer and musician, but actor he ain't) and the performances are beyond laughable to the vein burstingly cringing. give me bruce campbell any day.<br /><br />the visual effects are on the whole poor, with some atrocious cgi, awful gore effects (for goodness sakes, peter jackson did better and that was over ten years ago with less budget) and editing filters that shriek over-use! as for the often mistimed use of cradle of filth's score... man, they should sue.<br /><br />the fundamental problem with cradle of fear is that it takes itself seriously, trying to build atmosphere and incite terror and repulsion within its audience. too many good horror films made in the seventies and eighties do this so much better with far superior gore effects (eg: maniac, zombie flesh eaters, the beyond, suspiria etc), rendering cradle of fear, in my mind, second-rate and obsolete.<br /><br />i hope chandon can learn from this hideous ghoul of a film and go on to make some quality horror that actually scares.<br /><br />better luck next time.	1
normally when i go on a raid of the local hollywood video i head towards the b-horror movies. to me the basic principals behind a b-horror movie is it's camp value, heavy gore, lots of needless nudity, and special effects that anyone can put together with a pack of corn syrup and latex. i rented cradle of fear strictly because i've been a fan of the band since they released they're first demo in 1995. the movie started off on an interesting note and then when i saw dani filth stomp on an extremely obvious latex mask i laughed. when i saw the lesbian sex scene for the sake of a lesbian sex scene i laughed even harder. i spent pretty much the entire movie laughing and when i wasn't laughing i was shaking my head thinking about how a multi-million dollar rock star would want to make a movie that seemed like it was on a budget of multi-hundreds of dollars. the whole point of this movie to me seemed to attract the ""hardcore goth kids who think death, destruction, sex, blood, and satan are the greatest things invented since lava lamps. that was really it. to me this movie seemed like 80.5% of the things that happened in this movie just happened for the sake of being satanic. this movie had a lot of potential and really could have been a real good movie but in the end this ""movie"" really is just an extended cradle of filth video.	1
i rented this dvd for two reasons. a cast of great actors, and the director, even though robert altman can be hit or miss. in this case, it was a big miss. altman's attempt at creating suspense fell on its keester. after seeing kenneth branagh in a good film like ""dead again"", i didn't think he could possibly contribute to such a turkey, and i hope it didn't ruin his reputation. robert duvall seems to have fallen the way of most one-time oscar winners. on a downward spiral that includes acting in eating-money films such as this one. duvall was once a great actor in excellent films, even though his best performance was not ""tender mercies"", but ""the great santini"". this movie was truly a big waste of time. i give it a 2 out of 10.	1
this movie has a few things going for it right off the bat. having dani filth as a lead actor is automatically going to make some people like this movie. admittedly, i love cradle of filth and listened to the soundtrack to this movie long before i watched it. dani filth is a very recognizable character and makes for a great lead. the independent filming style of the movie is great for the creepy factor. there are some gorgeous actresses in this movie. for being low budget, the special effects weren't bad either. the ways that people died were very creative and nightmarish.<br /><br />now on to the cons. there is very little talking throughout this whole movie, thus making for very little as far as character development. it's hard to fear for the lives of limp, static characters. when there was a little talking, the f bomb was abundant, popping up in random places. yes, i understand people swear but it seems like a preteen boy scripted this and thought himself cool for including all the language. the storyline, what i could make out of it, was pretty good although many parts are left dangling and the lack of conversation leaves one often wondering what's happening.<br /><br />in the end, cradle of fear is like a porno for people who love sex and violence, but like a porno trying to pull of a storyline, it just doesn't work too well. rent it though, if you're a morbid person looking to sate your blood and flesh appetite.	1
this movie was made for fans of dani (and cradle of filth). i am not one of them. i think he's just an imitator riding the black metal bandwagon (still, i'm generally not a fan of black metal). but as i was carrying this dvd case to pay for it, i convinced myself, that the less authentic something is the more it tries to be convincing. thus i assumed i'm in for a roller-coaster ride of rubber gore and do-it-yourself splatter with a sinister background. now, that is what i do like.<br /><br />i got home and popped it in. my patience lasted 15 minutes. awful camera work and disgusting quality. and that was then (2002), that it looked like it was shot using a hi8 camcorder. i left it on the shelf. maybe a nice evening with beer and bmovies would create a nice setting for this... picture. <br /><br />after a couple of months i got back to it (in mentioned surroundings) and saw half. then not only the mentioned aspects annoyed me. my disliking evolved. i noticed how funny dani (1,65m; 5'5"" height) looked in his platform shoes ripping a head of a mugger apart. (yes, ripping. his head apparently had no skull.) i also found that this movie may have no sense. still, i haven't finished it yet, so i wasn't positive.<br /><br />after a couple more tries i finally managed to finish this flick - a couple of months back... (yes, it took me 5,5 years.) so - dani in fact was funny as satan/manson/super-evil-man's helper and the movie did not make sense. see our bad person employs dani to do bad things. he delivers. why? well i guess he's just very, very bad. as a matter of fact they both are and that is pretty much it.<br /><br />we have a couple of short stories joined by dani's character. my favourite was about a guy, who steals someone's leg, because he wants to use it as his own. yeah, exactly. <br /><br />the acting's rock bottom. the cgi is the worst ever. i mean stinger beats it (and, boy, is stinger's cgi baaaaad). the story has no sense. and the quality is... let's just say it is not satisfying. the only thing that might keep you watching is the unmotivated violence and gore. blood and guts are made pretty well. why, you can actually see that the movie originated there and then moved on. (example - dani 'the man' filth takes a stuffed cat - fake as can be - and guts it... and then eats what fell out. why? we never know. we do know, however, that this cat must have been on illegal substances, as his heart is almost half his size.)<br /><br />you might think, after my comment that this movie is so bad it's good, but it's just bad. cradle of filth fans can add 3 points. i added one for gore.	1
this film is a very funny film. the violence is bad, the acting is...well dani, stick to singing or screaming or whatever the hell it is you usually do. the random chicks wearing hardly anything is just to catch sexually-frustrated goth lads in. personally, i think this movie really does suck. the story and characters could be very good, if say the directing, the actors and other little nibby things were made better. but the film is just bad, the only reason why people like this piece of crap is because it has danni in it. this film is possibly the worst b-rate film ever. and, believe me that's hard to achieve, especially when you're competing with def by temptation and over crappy excuses for ""serious"" horror movies. i'm not a cof fan, and so i just see this as another rubbish movie...a really bad one. if dani made this as a comedy then, good going him. very well done. over than that though, i rate it low, for it's crappiness. watch it when you're in a happy, happy, joy, joy mode so you can laugh at everything or if you're high on multiple different types of drugs.	1
...and you can look at that statement in different ways, by the way. first of all, it's a mess because of all the gruesome and extremely violent scenes. your wildest imagination doesn't even come close to some of the explicitly shown scenes here. entire parts of this movie are just plain sick, disgusting, offensive, brutal and they bring you close to puking your guts out. now, i love horror movies and i am very 'pro-violence', but i do think that it has to lead somewhere !! is that too much to ask ? cradle of fear is just a series of utterly sick and twisted thoughts. the ""movie"" contains out of four separate chapters connected by a wraparound story. this results in endless showing of torture, murder and sickness only to find out that the victims have something in common. not very informative, if you ask me. and yet - it has to be said - the basic plot idea surely has potential. it's about a cannibalistic hypnotist who made a deal with the devil himself to avenge himself and cause misery and death to everyone who was involved in his trial. personally, i think that is an interesting topic, so they should have focused on that a little more instead of wanting to create the most disgusting movie ever.<br /><br />secondly, the whole production of this movie was a mess. they didn't have much of a budget and they spent it all on fake blood and guts...tons of it !! the acting performances are a joke and some of the worst i've ever seen. any other special effects besides the make-up looks very amateurish ( like that attempt to a realistic car crash, for example ). there's no tension or atmosphere to detect anywhere...not even an attempt to build up one.<br /><br />cradle of fear is a failure and a missed opportunity to say the least. with the presence of death-metal icon danni filth ( from the band cradle of filth..get the link ? ) this movie is obviously only meant for the eyes of twisted teenagers who try to be controversial. troubled girls and boys who take pleasure in worrying their parents by watching crap like this. and then people keep complaining that the amount of suicides and juvenile delinquency is increasing...bah. i can imagine that this movie can cause a lot of damage when you're easily influenced or dispose of an unstable mind. for every self-respecting horror fan, this movie is an insult.	1
cradle of fear<br /><br />this isn't a movie where intricate delicate little narrative nuances occupy our attention. this is not a film where the special effects are supposed to leave us slack-jacked uttering that sense of whoa. what it is though is a slice of lo-fi goth horror which leaves little to the imagination, created in the eyes of the director, alex chandon, as ""a throwback to sleazy '70s and '80s horror"".<br /><br />this is a very visceral experience for 2 hours, where four plot lines are connected through lots of watery blood, reams of dismembered body parts and innards, tied by an intestinal thread of revenge. <br /><br />the purveyor of such horrific violence is dani filth, lead-singer of the metal band cradle of filth, executing a role he was destined to play. <br /><br />as other's have said, there is nothing new about wanting to carryout occultist revenge. in this particular context a convicted sexual predator and murderer, kemper, the father of our devilish avenging-angel, compels his son to exact retribution on those who are some how connected to convicting him to purgatory within an insane asylum.<br /><br />what this provides for the chandon, who should be congratulated on also penning and editing this piece, is the opportunity to let his sick mind run free. he seems to take delight in the idea of splattering blood into the orifices of those on screen, and into every nook and cranny that can be reached. we are also treated to close-ups of skull's being crushed, demonic rape, and other assorted imagery to engage those who relish getting up close and personal to their horror. and for some of those who closely follow these type of films, there is the odd sequence which may have you thinking, ""did i just see what i thought i did"", because of course pretty woman this 'aint. it reminds me of some of the gore-fests created out of italian horror some 20 to 30 years ago, and a number of other works where disgusting images have left their mark but not the context in which they were viewed.<br /><br />story 4 of the set is particularly intriguing where the idea of ones obsession can ultimately lead to death in the pursuit of internet violence through the ""sick room"", where the user is in control of how a life can be snuffed out. further acknowledgements should also go out to a pounding soundtrack that allows filth to exercise his daytime talent, and an effective use of drum and bass, often overlooked in film-making as a viable form of supporting visuals. using the city of london as a backdrop with real people as opposed to movie stand-ins also adds support to the commando feel of the film. ok, classic it may not be, but blood, guts, intestines, occult and demons in a slightly perverse unproblematic way it is.	1
this sure is one comedy i'm not likely to forget for a while.<br /><br />wouldn't normally bother to comment on this movie: it's so minor that no one would watch it anyway, but as it happens, it's kind of popular in p2p sharing networks such as kazaa, and so this saaad production needs to be exposed for what it is.<br /><br />so what is it then? well, of course it's not really a comedy; instead, it's intended as a horror flick -- ""intended"" very much being the key word here. the script is a totally incoherent and unbalanced mess, the special effects are only special in that they're especially pathetic, and as for the acting, well, let's just say that if this had been my graduating play at primary school, my teachers would have burst out crying at our talent.<br /><br />of course i realise that this is a very low budget film and that in those cases one should lower one's expectations, certainly as far as things like special effects are concerned. also, even though i'm a big fan of the horror genre, i'm aware that these movies are only rarely the places to look for interesting scripts and top notch acting.<br /><br />but still.<br /><br />b-movies often have some redeeming features to make up for the lack of funding, such as humour. the only laughs in cradle to fear lie in the ridiculous performances. if you can find the humour in that--and i could for the first 20 minutes or so, gradually dozing off after that--then that's going to be the only thing the movie has to offer. oh, that and two or three pairs of breasts.<br /><br />woohoo, how exciting.<br /><br />as for the story, it's not even that it doesn't try to convey anything: the victims either use drugs and/or are involved in serious crime. the lesson: watch out, naughty boys and girls, because one day you'll be made to pay for what you've done.<br /><br />i rest my case.<br /><br />so, all in all, a little bit of sex, a fair amount of drugs, but absolutely zero rock 'n roll.<br /><br />i rate this one 1 out of 10, but would go to 0 if i could. or perhaps i wouldn't: it deserves a 1 for spelling the actors' names correctly in the titles. i mean, that's something, innit?	1
now look, i won't lie to you, but i only got this movie for $3.99 from a friend because it had danni filth, the lead singer of the ever popular death metal band ""cradle of filth"" in it. i expected of course violence and gore at its finest, as that is what mr filth can be portrayed as, amongst a plot line.<br /><br />but dear god, i was oh so wrong. this movie seriously bites, big time. being a low budget film (haha, wait, make that zero budget), this obviously lacks the beautiful howard stern orchestra musical scores and the spielberg special effects. nope, it's all one camera, bad angles, and bad blood scenes.<br /><br />take for example when our star and violent fiend, mr filth, violently kills a mugger. a grab at the throat, and blood spits out, but oh my, it looks like there's a juice packet filled with fake blood in the man's shirt.<br /><br />to you cradle of filth fans: you'll hear two songs throughout the movie, but with the camera angles and shoddy filming, they drag the overall pleasure of the song down.<br /><br />my final comment: steer well away from it. it's blood, gore, breasts, and hey, even a shoddy story to go with it. so if you like appalling violence, near no voices (yes, there's hardly any words in this movie), then by all means, buy it. but if shoddy movies isn't your thing, then avoid it. don't waste your money.	1
check out the film's website, more time was put into making that than in the writing of the script for this movie. it couldn't be more off in it's boasting. original story? original? they must have found the script tucked away between the old testament, or face legal repercussion for that bit of horn-tooting. high-end special effects? come on, i could do better with an atari 7600 and a jug of earwax. stylish cinematography? oh yes, the america's funniest home video look is still a classic. i'm sure they had little money available for this title, so of course the sf aren't really that good, or a bit bad now and then, or just plain hilarious, but it's the story that makes this film a waste of time and money. 4 stories rolled into one and all of them brainless bits of seen-befores and done-already's.	1
i didn't know if i would laugh or cry seeing this. only addicted fans of danni filth could have a taste for this. this is supposed to be a horror movie but there's only filth in this. the most cool scene is the car accident, with real special effects from the best of hollywood. avoid this movie at all costs. see this only for studies of how bad can be a movie................	1
this is another of the many b minus movies tagged as film noir in the hope of generating some interest in something that is devoid of it. all aspects of the film - script, acting, direction - are mediocre. the acting by the three leads is wooden. i guess john dall was expected to go places in the movie business but then someone realised he had little talent and therefore ended up doing tv work. lee j cobb who is usually terrific cannot rise above the poor script and poor direction. jane wyatt is supposed to be a femme fatale but comes nowhere near convincing the viewers. the movie does have two of the strangest looking cars that i have ever seen, the one in which john dall goes after lee j cobb is particularly strange. the dvd transfer is typical alpha.	1
did anyone who was making this movie, particularly the director, spare a thought for the logic of the story-line? these are not mere plot-holes, but plot graves, that become ever deeper as we lose any sympathy for the main character and his plight. that is, if you are kind enough a viewer to valiantly ignore the fact for most of the movie that the characters are either servants to the grave-hole plot, or boring and unlikeable. or, in the case of downey's & hannah's characters, apparently superfluous. in pondering the reason for existence of downey's character's significant screen-time in the movie, i decided that either the director had liked his character and unnecessarily increased his screen-time (unlikley, as the director didn't change anything else about the script he actually needed to) or that his character was going to be sacrificed on the altar of bad plotting. i'll leave you to guess which one it was to be.<br /><br />i had to keep checking the cover of the dvd to confirm that this really was made by credible talents. i cannot understand why robert altman would take this job. surely he has some power to pick and chose. actually, i can't understand why anyone would take this script on, except a first-time director looking for the experience.<br /><br />i suppose robert downey jr. needed the money for his habit. i suppose kenneth branagh wanted to try a southern accent. i suppose robert duvall was only given a few pages of the script and thought the role in isolation sounded intriguing. these are the only motivations i can see that would coerce good actors to take on roles in this movie. as for robert altman, plenty of effort has gone in on his part to making the movie look fantastic. i found myself noticing how he had framed such and such a scene, or used the bright orange float vests in another scene to draw the eye's movements, or imposed a beautiful filter to create a particular mood. i do not typically notice such things in movies, since most movies i bother to watch to the end actually engage me for reasons of good story-telling and interesting characters with understandable motives. i watched this to the end only because some ridiculous element of optimism in myself kept looking at that dvd cover and being convinced that, due to the talent involved, there had to be some redeeming factor in this movie.<br /><br />nice direction. but that's not why i watch movies.	1
this was a disappointing film for me. it came to me via a boxed set entitled, ""classic film noir,"" which was a gift from someone who knows i typically enjoy films done in that style (i insist that noir is a style, not a genre). i do not think it is a noir film at all. there seems to be a tendency these days to label and market every black and white b movie made from 1947 to 1955 as noir, and the label does not always fit. there is a persecuted male protagonist, ed cullen (lee j. cobb), and most of the film's action takes place indoors. those are just about the only noir elements that i could see. there is no pervasive paranoia, or any real reason why one should sympathize with ed cullen. jane wyatt was overdressed and unconvincing as a femme fatale. i do not want to spoil this film for potential viewers. however, i would be interested in hearing what other connoisseurs of film noir have to say about it.	1
maybe i'm missing something because i've read more positive things about the man who cheated himself than i have read bad reviews - and i just don't get it. i like my noirs to have a little style to them with characters that speak, look, and act like humphrey bogart in the big sleep or gene tierney in laura. none of the characters in this movie have that style or presence or whatever you want to call it. take the lead actor, lee j. cobb. his rumpled, rolled-out-of-bed look is about as far from the dashing, smooth-talking noir archetype as you'll find. or, take jane wyatt as the femme fatale as another example. this is one of the worst cases of miscasting i've seen in a while. she's just not convincing in the role.<br /><br />as for the plot, it's tired and lacks any real surprises or anything new for the genre. i could have predicted the outcome of the man who cheated himself after about five minutes. and that final cat-and-mouse chase scene is plain old dull. ten to fifteen minutes of nothing happening really ruined any pacing the movie may have had going for it.	1
i watched like 8 or 9 herzog movies and none of them had any impact on me.<br /><br />i watched several documentaries about him. he is obviously an intelligent man, with great knowledge about films and passion for making them, but does this makes him a good director. definitely no! a complete anti-talent. he can make a good documentary because of previously mentioned traits, but a film with actors  never!<br /><br />he can't direct nor write. his screenplays are full of badly thought out situations, and many situations/dialogues in his movies are so childishly and badly done that they cannot be hidden behind the word ""art"" in any sense. no way. not to mention the unskillful direction, so amateurish-like. to say that he wants to direct like that and write crap like that is a lie.<br /><br />like the scene when scheitz gets arrested and storszek hides in the back of the store. who is he kidding?<br /><br />he is a cheater; he knows what fake intellectuals and critics want. he knows what elements he needs to put in the script to get your their attention and empty praising. never mind the rest of the script and sloppy direction.<br /><br />just look at julio medem. if herzog can make a movie like medem can, then i might re-check his old movies and try to find talent in them.	1
lage raho munnabhai is really a disappointing movie . i have seen the first part of munnabhai and it was really good but this one really make u bore n disappoint u.......................................<br /><br />this movie really waste yours time and money . i went with my friend to this movie on the first day of its release and v both get bore in cinema-hall......................................................<br /><br />role of circuit was very small n useless n this movie . i think sanjay-dutt cut down the role of arshad varshi........................<br /><br />character of the movie is also not well define like the previous one .this movie show u the result of over-confidence .........<br /><br />the ideas of mahatma is also not define and confusing..................<br /><br />a really very big disappointment	1
i love the munna bhai mbbs but ""lagge raho..."" sux really sux. i have never seen such a boring movie in my whole life. and these high ratings really astonished me that wat happened to the taste of indian cinema viewers ?? <br /><br />**may be spoiler** <br /><br />an educated girl needs an advice from a bhai, people discussing their personal prob. on phones come on man from which part of the world u r ??? i agree that films should be fictitious but these things are really indigestible.<br /><br />2 out of 10. (2 stars is for 15 mins good starting)	1
let's see where to begin... bad acting; i'm not sure if i'd even call it that, as it more along the lines of a no-effort script read. the actors didn't even seem to be into their parts and seemed quite lifeless and listless. sure there was a scene or two with nudity, but that couldn't save this movie from it's lifeless characters.<br /><br />to call the main character a rapper is an insult to the people who actually do. the lyrics had no rhythm or flow and seemed more along the lines of senseless rants.<br /><br />budget? did this movie even have a budget? it seemed like they used less money than i've seen in a home-shot youtube video. bad lighting, props, poor sound post production. bad special effects, if you want to go so far as to call them that. story could have been good if the people actually seemed interested in making it so, but there was no life to this flick; i don't care who directed it.<br /><br />i've seen some really bad flicks in the past year and this one is definitely at the very bottom. don't waste your time or you'll be wishing you listened to this unbiased review. check the ratings, you'll see the 1's are rapidly outpacing the fluffed 10's with hardly anything in between. wish i would have looked a little closer before wasting my time. what a suck-fest!	1
this is a film that makes you say 2 things... 1) i can do much better than this( acting,writing and directing) 2) this is so bad i must leave a review and warn others...<br /><br />looks as if it was shot with my flip video. i have too believe my friend who told me to watch this has a vendetta against me. i have noticed that there are some positive posts for this home video; must have been left by crew members or people with something to do with this film. one of the worst 3 movies i have ever seen. hopefully the writers and director leave the business. not even talented enough to do commercials!!!!!	1
with a story and screenplay that seems to have been written by a high schooler, 'the art of seduction' fails to deliver the romantic, sophisticated experience it tries to bill itself as. the two main characters have the potential to be interesting - both male and female lead are ""swinging singles (or in the female lead's case, engaged)"", but 'the art of seduction' doesn't even try. shirking from a frank examination of these two characters' personalities, 'the art of seduction' eschews anything of substance for a basis of thin, lean stereotype. <br /><br />'the art of seduction' is insulting - insulting to its characters, insulting to men and women, and insulting to its audiences' expectations. it takes the awful beautiful people we all know and plays out their painful interactions while expecting us to idolize them. ji-wan is an immature, spoiled, manipulative bitch. the viewer is expected to like and forgive her flaws because she's pretty. min-jun, well, he's exactly the same. neither are nice people. the ""humour"" in this film primarily revolve around ji-wan and min-jun's outlandish attempts at outdoing each other in the honourable art of lying and manipulation. no character development occurs, and we never learn why ji-wan and min-jun are like this. we are simply expected to take them as they are, and not ask questions - they're cute!, and that's all that matters. the copious references to the celebrity of the main actors in azn cinema scenester's reviews may tip you off to 'art of seduction's shallowness. <br /><br />if you're still in high school, you liked grease, or you are a yellow fever victim, you may like this movie.<br /><br />despite its ""romance"" tag, this is not a very good date movie.	1
a friend of mine lent this video to me and i was fairly excited to watch it, but after ten minutes of james hetfield's slow pitched vocals and lars banging on his drum set in what appeared to be slow motion i began to think, `why am i watching this?' that question will be coursing through your minds in 5  10 minutes after you hit play. i gave the tape back the same day, as you would suspect, not worth buying or watching!<br /><br />just my opinion!<br /><br />	1
in spite of its impressive cast and crew pedigree gingerbread man crumbles early and often. the plot is unrealistically convoluted, the actors sport bad accents and director robert altman's participation amounts to collecting a pay check. once again he has assembled an impressive cast (like woody allen, everyone wants to work with altman)that this time around to the letter is miscast. but that's only part of the problem.<br /><br />kenneth branagh is rick magruder a high powered georgia lawyer who in the film's heavy handed opening scenes manages to get himself preposterously seduced by a mysterious catering company waitress who convinces him she is in grave danger from an ex-husband and a loony dad. with red flags everywhere the astute lawyer plods on even managing to get his children in harms way. fights of gun and fist follow along with a requisite car chase and if that's not enough there's a hurricane thrown in for the ridiculous finale.<br /><br />branagh plays macgruder with a mealy and unconvincing southern accent. running around in a trench coat in all kinds of weather he's blind to the obvious in order to keep the story going. hipster bob downey jr. is every bit as bad as a p.i. but with a little more emphasis on the bad accent. robert duvall as the old man is boo radely all growed up en crazier than a bed bug serving some thick slices of ham but at least his twang is plausible. the female leads (embeth davidtz, darryl hannah, famkhee jansen)are lean leggy and unemotive. even the celebrity lawyers doing cameos (vernon jordan) are wooden with the few throw away lines they have.<br /><br />in addition to paying little attention to his actors, altman's mise en scene dripping with spanish moss is murky and shapeless, his action scenes comic book. it lacks his offbeat touches and observations (he does inform the viewer that the stars and bars still wave in georgia)that make a well done altman so unique. unfortunately, gingerbread man is altman at his worst, even if the pay is the same.	1
bill (buddy rogers) is sent to new york by his uncle (richard tucker) to experience life before he inherits $25million. his uncle has paid 3 women jacqui (kathryn crawford), maxine (josephine dunn) and pauline (carole lombard) to chaperone him and ensure that he does not fall foul of gold-diggers. one such lady cleo (geneva mitchell) turns up on the scene to the disapprovement of the women. we follow the tale as the girls are offered more money to appear in a show instead of their escorting role that they have agreed to carry out for the 3 months that bill is in new york, while bill meets with cleo and another woman. at the end, love is in the air for bill and one other .............<br /><br />the picture quality and sound quality are poor in this film. the story is interspersed with musical numbers but the songs are bad and kathryn crawford has a terrible voice. rogers isn't that good either. he's pleasant enough but only really comes to life when playing the drums or trombone. there is a very irritating character who plays a cab driver (roscoe karns) and the film is just dull.	1
i had read many good things about this adaptation of my favorite novel...so invariably my expectations were crushed. but they were crushed more than should be expected. the movie would have been a decent movie if i had not read the novel beforehand, which perhaps ruined it for me.<br /><br />in any event, for some reason they changed the labor camp at toulon to a ship full of galley slaves. the scene at bishop myriel's was fine. in fact, other than the galleys, things survived up until the dismissal of fantine. because we do not want to have bad things happen to a good woman, she does not cut her hair, sell her teeth, or become a prostitute. the worst she does is run into the mayor's office and spit on his face. bamatabois is entirely eliminated. because having children out of wedlock should also not be talked about, tholomyes is fantine's dead husband, rather than an irresponsible dandy. valjean is able to fetch cosette for fantine before the champmathieu affair, so they reunite happily, yet another change. then comes the convent, which is a pretty difficult scene to screw up. thankfully, it was saved. after this three minutes of accuracy, however, the movie again begins to hurtle towards classic novel butchering.<br /><br />as cosette and valjean are riding through the park, they come across marius giving a speech at a meeting. about prison reform. when he comes to hand out fliers to valjean and cosette, he says the one line in the movie that set me screaming at the tv set. ""we aren't revolutionaries."" i could hear victor hugo thrashing in his grave. of course they are revolutionaries! they want to revolt against the pseudo-monarchy that is in place in favor of another republic, you dumb screenwriters! it's a historical fact that there was an insurrection against the government in 1832. <br /><br />at one point cosette goes to give marius a donation from her father for the reform movement and meets eponine. except...not eponine. or at least not the eponine of the book. this eponine appears to be a well-to-do secretary girl working for the prison reformers (who are working out of the cafe universal as opposed to the cafe musain). not to mention the audience is already made to dislike her thanks to her not-period, low-cut, tight-fitting dress and her snooty mannerisms.<br /><br />the prison reformers (lead by the most poorly cast enjolras that i have ever seen) decide that handing out pamphlets isn't good enough anymore. so they're going to build barricades. i don't know about you, but i have never heard of reform movements tearing up the streets and building barricades and attacking government troops. about three hundred people (it was not supposed to be so many) start attacking the national guard and building a bunch of barricades, etc. eponine does die for marius, thankfully. <br /><br />the rest of the movie is sort of accurate, except that javert's suicide again seems hard to understand thanks to his minuscule screen time and odd character interpretation. the movie ends with valjean watching javert jump into the river. this is again inaccurate because valjean would never have let javert drown. he saved the man's life earlier, why let him die now? then there's the whole skipping of valjean's confession to marius, his deterioration, and his redemption on his deathbed with marius and cosette by his side.<br /><br />overall, i can blame the script mostly for the problems. while i am glad enjolras and eponine were at least present in the film, they were terribly misinterpreted, as was the entire barricade scene. the elimination of fantine's suffering prevents us from feeling too much pity for her. that cosette knows valjean's past from the start messes with the plot a good deal. i did not even see thenardier, and mme. thenardier only had a few seconds of screen time. the same with gavroche. i did like frederich march's interpretation of valjean a lot, however, which was one of the redeeming features of the movie. on the other hand, charles laughton, for all his great acting in other movies, seems to have missed the mark with javert. the lip tremble, the unnecessary shouting, and his acting in general all just felt very wrong. he also, like many javerts i have seen, did not appear at all menacing, something required of the character.<br /><br />again, this film would probably feel much better if i had not read the book. i would not recommend it to book purists, though. i would also say that the movie would have been a good adaptation for the time had not the infamously accurate french version come out the year before.	1
here's an indie film i really wanted to like, but ultimately could not. the lack of script (boldly proclaimed in the main titles) really shows through and kills the picture. the story is a nonsensical mess that isn't worth trying to figure out. i quickly became bored within 10 minutes, then suffered through the remainder of the first 40 minutes--hoping for the best--before hitting the chapter stops to (mercifully) get to the end... even that wasn't worth the extra effort. ozark savage clearly tries too hard to be clever, lifting its best sequences from evil dead 2 and the matrix. as a result, there's very little in ozark savage that hasn't been done before, and better. this film would have been much more fun as a 10-20 minute short, but as a feature, it just feels padded and forced. of course, there's no money in shorts, so i completely understand the financial reasons that i assume motivated it being stretched out to 75+ minutes. director matt steinauer shows great promise, and i wish him luck.	1
many people thought that this is a good movie but i don't agree with them. at the beginning of the movie, a spaceship crushed on earth and some of the aliens escaped from the spaceship, then hey killed some people on the earth, but for no reason. also, it is in a dark forest, i can't see anything on the screen, i can only hardly hear the sound.<br /><br />after a few days, the predator came to the earth but no one had sent signals to him before that, he should not know what happened on the earth, so there is a contradiction. finally, the predator found the headmaster of the aliens and killed it for no reason. he was not live on earth, t is none of his business about the things happened here. lastly, the duration of the movie is only 90 minutes long, the summary is too short and it can't tell the reviewers about the story clearly.<br /><br />in conclusion, i don't think this is a good movie.	1
i just finished a marathon of this series, and it became agonising to watch as it progressed. from the fictionalising of the historical elements, to o'herlihy's awful accent in later episodes, the show just slumps the further it goes. if you are looking for some low quality production generalised ww2 fluff, then i could recommend season 1, but avoid anything after that, it degenerates into being one step from a soap opera, with increasingly worse story lines and sensibility.<br /><br />the old b&w film is by far the best of any form of entertainment with the colditz name attached to it, and even that is not what one could hope for.	1
saw this 'film' recently and have to say it was the worst attempt at film making i have ever had the misfortune to see. what the hell was going on with coolio? totally unprovoked shooting at people in distress. totally uninvolving, slow, tedious and detached. worse than spawn. long live ""evil dead ii"".	1
what the hell of a d-movie was that? bad acting, bad special effects and the worst dialogues/storyline i ever came across. the only cool thing here was coolio, who had a nice cameo as a freaked out cop. however, the rest of the film is awful and boring. it's not even so bad, you can laugh about it. just plain crap. and whoever compares this to the evil dead series might as well compare tomb raider to indiana jones (well, ok, at least there was angelina jolie in tomb raider)! 1 out of 10	1
this movie is bad! it's basically an overdone copy of michael jackson's thriller video, only worse! the special effects consist of lots of glow in the dark paint, freaky slapstick fastmoving camera shots and lots of growling. i think the dog was the best actor in the whole movie.	1
this film is so much of a rip-off of the masterpeice ""demons"" and thats the only thing that makes the movie worth watching. the acting is terrible,the action scenes are speeded up,the script is almost painful and budget non existent.<br /><br />if you think this film is good then you havn't seen a real horror film, skip this and get a copy of the movie demons.	1
lame, lame, lame!!! a 90-minute cringe-fest that's 89 minutes too long. a setting ripe with atmosphere and possibility (an abandoned convent) is squandered by a stinker of a script filled with clunky, witless dialogue that's straining oh-so-hard to be hip. mostly it's just embarrassing, and the attempts at gonzo horror fall flat (a sample of this movie's dialogue: after demonstrating her artillery, fast dolly shot to a closeup of barbeau's vigilante charactershe: `any questions?' hyuck hyuck hyuck). bad acting, idiotic, homophobic jokes and judging from the creature effects, it looks like the director's watched `the evil dead' way too many times. <br /><br />i owe my friends big time for renting this turkey and subjecting them to ninety wasted minutes they'll never get back. what a turd.	1
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. while featuring good actors the movie doesn't live up to the expectations. the most dramatic thing about this movie is the music, which pretty much sums up the movie: compensating for a bad and confusing storyline by having known-good actors, loud and dramatic music. it doesn't change the fact, that this is a very boring movie to watch. earned itself a score of 1.	1
this is arguably the worst film i have ever seen, and i have quite an appetite for awful (and good) movies. it could (just) have managed a kind of adolescent humour if it had been consistently tongue-in-cheek --à la rocky horror picture show, which was really very funny. other movies, like plan nine from outer space, manage to be funny while (apparently) trying to be serious. as to the acting, it looks like they rounded up brain-dead teenagers and asked them to ad-lib the whole production. compared to them, tom cruise looks like alec guinness. there was one decent interpretation -- that of the older ghoul-busting broad on the motorcycle.	1
my friend's mom used to work at a video store and got to preview movies before they came out, so when she brought home the convent, a horror movie, i couldn't wait to watch it. given that it's supposed to be scary but is actually downright hilarious, i can say that in some weird way, i like this movie. <br /><br />yes, the acting is bad, and yes, it's the cheapest movie i've ever seen, but it's so damn funny! ""what, are you smoking ca-rack?!"" i didn't know this movie even was ever released... i figured it was too bad... <br /><br />yeah, so... overall the movie is pretty bad (you gotta admit that much at least) but i promise you, you will get a good laugh out of it.<br /><br />*this movie kinda sucks but it's good for a laugh... especially that guy that holds the 'dagger of despair'.. the dagger of despaaaaaair!	1
this film wasn't programmed in italian cinemas,i have seen it at a manifestation called ""fantafestival"".i find it terrible because some scenes seems like music videos chaotic and dark, the use of fluorescent colors is ridicule and there's no suspence in the film. music is completely out of the story and i don't have words to describe the visual effects.if you look at the first scene the film seems to be interesting, but a few minutes later it becomes busy.the story is interesting but the development needs a complete review.	1
in fact, these young people were so distasteful that i couldn't wait for all of 'em to get slaughtered, and that includes clarissa (joanna canton) since i considered her the most annoying of the bunch.<br /><br />but i knew it was gonna be a mess from the opening minutes when a teen christine opened fired on the priest and the nuns with the leslie gore music playing in the background. it had nowhere to go but down.<br /><br />even the prosthetics looked fake and the ""blood"" looked suspiciously like hawaiian punch, although later on it took on red day-glo look to match the silly halloween makeup they were all wearing. i'm sure all the goth morons out there will appreciate this bullsh-t since it'll appeal to that bunch. it sure didn't appeal to me. blah...<br /><br />and not even my favorite horror babe adrienne barbeau can save this stupid teen horror flick from itself. she still looks hot, though. i'm glad she takes care of herself since we don't get to see too much of her nowadays.<br /><br />however, it is a step up from dante tomaselli's meandering horror (2002) in that it has a somewhat coherent plot, so i'll give it that much. that and the little boston terrier named boozer also brings it up a notch. i like what boozer does to clarissa in the end. it was the only good scene in an otherwise silly film.<br /><br />lion's gate films sure must have been desperate when they picked this one up.<br /><br />2 out of 10	1
when i tell people that i review movies as a hobby, the first thing they say is ""what do you think of such-and-such movie?"" there are a couple of problems here. firstly, there is the probable chance that i've not seen it and thus, i ruin my reputation. secondly, i could trash the movie in question without realising that it's actually their favourite. lastly, i could be given dvds to watch so they can judge my opinion. thus, i find myself sat before ""the convent"" which is the sort of film i would ignore completely given the choice but unable to avoid here. more's "
